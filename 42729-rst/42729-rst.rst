   THE WANDERERS.

.. vspace:: 2

On a certain sunny afternoon in May, when all the
world and his wife were walking or driving in
Piccadilly, two figures appeared there who clearly
did not belong to the fashionable crowd.  Indeed,
so unusual was their aspect that many a swift
glance, shot from carefully impassive faces, made
furtive scrutiny of them as they passed.  One of
the strangers was an old man who might have been
a venerable Scandinavian scald come to life again—a
man thick-set and broad-shouldered, with features
at once aquiline and massive, and with flowing hair
and beard almost silver-white.  From under his
deeply lined forehead and shaggy eyebrows
gleamed a pair of eyes that were alert and
confident as with the audacity of youth; and the heavy
white moustache and beard did not quite conceal
the cheerful firmness of the mouth.  For the rest,
he wore above his ordinary attire a plaid of
shepherd's tartan, the ends loosely thrown over his
shoulders.

By his side there walked a young girl of about
seventeen, whose singular, if somewhat pensive and
delicate beauty, could not but have struck any
passer-by who happened to catch sight of her.  But
she rarely raised her eyes from the pavement.
What was obvious to every one was, first of all, the
elegance of her walk—which was merely the
natural expression of a perfectly moulded form;
and then the glory of her hair, which hung free and
unrestrained down her back, and no doubt added
to the youthfulness of her look.  As to the colour
of those splendid masses—well, it was neither
flaxen, nor golden, nor brown, nor golden-brown,
but apparently a mixture of all these shades,
altering in tone here and there according to sunshine
or shadow, but always showing a soft and graduated
sheen rather than any definite lustre.  Her face, as
has been said, was mostly downcast; and one could
only see that the refined and sensitive features
were pale; also that there was a touch of sun-tan
over her complexion, that spoke of travel.  But
when, by inadvertence, or by some forced
overcoming of her native diffidence, she did raise her
eyes, there flashed a revelation upon the world; for
these blue-grey deeps seemed to hold light; a
mild-shining light, timid, mysterious, appealing
almost; the unconsciousness of childhood no longer
there, the self-possession of womanhood not yet
come: then those beautiful, limpid, pathetic eyes,
thus tremblingly glancing out for a second, would
be withdrawn, and again the dark lashes would veil
the mystic, deep-shining wells.  This was Maisrie
Bethune; the old man beside her was her grandfather.

The young girl seemed rather to linger behind as
her companion went up the steps towards a certain
door and rang the bell; and her eyes were still
downcast as she followed him across the hall and
into an ante-room.  When the footman came back
with the message that his lordship was disengaged
and would see Mr. Bethune, and when he was about
to show the way upstairs, the girl hung back, and
said, with almost a piteous look—

"I will stay here, grandfather."

"Not at all," the old man answered, impatiently.
"Not at all.  Come along!"

There were two persons in this large and lofty
room on the first floor; but just as the visitors
arrived at the landing, one of these withdrew and
went and stood at a front window, where he could
look down into the street.  The other—a youngish-looking
man, with clear eyes and a pleasant smile—remained
to receive his guests; and if he could not
help a little glance of surprise—perhaps at the
unusual costume of his chief visitor, or perhaps
because he had not expected the young lady—there
was at all events nothing but good-nature in his face.

"My granddaughter, Maisrie, Lord Musselburgh,"
the old man said, by way of introduction, or
explanation.

The young nobleman begged her to be seated;
she merely thanked him, and moved away a little
distance, to a table on which were some illustrated
books; so that the two men were left free to talk
as they chose.

"Well now, that seems a very admirable project
of yours, Mr. Bethune," Lord Musselburgh said, in
his frank and off-hand way.  "There's plenty of
Scotch blood in my own veins, as you know; and I
am glad of any good turn that can be done to poor
old Scotland.  I see you are not ashamed of the
national garb."

"You remember what was said on a famous
occasion," the old man made answer, speaking
methodically and emphatically, and with a strong
northern accent, "and I will own that I hoped your
lordship's heart would 'warm to the tartan.'  For
it is a considerable undertaking, after all.  The men
are scattered; and their verses are scattered; but,
scattered or no scattered, there is everywhere and
always in them the same sentiment—the sentiment
of loyalty and gratitude and admiration for the land
of the hills and the glens.  And surely, as your
lordship says, it is doing a good turn to poor old
Scotland to show the world that wherever her sons
may be—in Canada, in Florida, out on the plains,
or along the Californian coast—they do not forget
the mother that bore them—no, but that they are
proud of her, and think always of her, and regard
her with an undying affection and devotion."

He was warming to his work.  There was a vibration
in his voice, as he proceeded to repeat the
lines—

   |  "From the lone shieling on the misty island,
   |    Mountains divide them and a world of seas;
   |  But still their hearts are true, their hearts are Highland,
   |    And they in dreams behold the Hebrides."
   |

"Is that by one of your Scotch-American
friends?" Lord Musselburgh asked, with a smile;
for he was looking curiously, and not without a
certain sympathetic interest, at this old man.

"I do not know, your lordship; at the moment I
could not tell you," was the answer.  "But this I
do know, that a man may be none the less a good
Canadian or American citizen because of his love
for the heather hills that nourished his infancy, and
inspired his earliest imagination.  He does not
complain of the country that has given him shelter,
nor of the people who have welcomed him and made
him one of themselves.  He only says with
Crichton's emigrant shepherd—

   |  "'Wae's me that fate us twa has twined'

—'twined' is severed: perhaps your lordship is not
so familiar with the dialect—

   |  "'Wae's me that fate us twa has twined;
   |    And I serve strangers ower the sea;
   |  Their hearts are leal, their words are kind,
   |    But, lass, it isna hame to me!'

Good men they are and true," he went on, in the
same exalted strain; "valued and respected citizens—none
more so; but cut their hearts open, and you
will find *Scotland* written in every fibre.  It is
through no ingratitude to their adopted country
that a spray of white heather, a few bluebells, a
gowan or two, anything sent across the seas to them
to remind them of the land of their birth, will bring
hot tears to their eyes.  As one of them has written—

   |  'What memories dear of that cot ye recall,
   |  Though now there remains neither rooftree nor wall!
   |  Alack-a-day! lintel and threshold are gone,
   |  While cold 'neath the weeds lies the hallowed hearthstone!
   |  'Twas a straw-roofed cottage, but love abode there,
   |  And peace and contentment aye breathed in its air;
   |  With songs from the mother, and legends from sire,
   |  How blithe were we all round the cheery peat-fire!
   |  —Caledonia's blue-bells, O bonnie blue-bells!'"
   |

"You have an excellent memory," Lord Musselburgh
said, good-naturedly.  "Those patriotic
effusions seem to have impressed you."

"That was written by the Bard of Amulree, your
lordship," continued the garrulous old man; "and
a truer Scotchman does not breathe, though America
has been his home nearly all his life.  And there
is many another, both in Canada and the United
States.  They may be in happier circumstances
than they would have been in the old country;
they may have plenty of friends around them: but
still their hearts turn back to

   |  'Where I've watched the gloamin' close
   |    The long bright summer days;
   |  And doubted not that fairies dwelt
   |    On Cathkin's bonnie braes;
   |  Auld Ruglin Brig and Cathkin braes
   |    And Clyde's meandering streams,
   |  Ye shall be subject of my lays
   |    As ye are of my dreams.'

Nor are they ashamed of their Scottish way of
speech—ye may observe, my lord, that I've kept a
twang of it myself, even among all my wanderings;
and loth would I be to lose it.  But I'm wearying
your lordship," the old man said, in a suddenly
altered tone.  "I would just say that a collection
of what the Scotch poets in America have written
ought to be interesting to Scotchmen everywhere,
and perhaps to others as well; for patriotism is a
virtue that commands respect.  I beg your pardon
for encroaching on your lordship's time——"

"Oh, that's nothing," Lord Musselburgh said,
easily; "but we must not keep the young lady
waiting."  He glanced in the direction of the girl
who was standing by the table.  She was turning
over the leaves of a book.  Then he resumed the
conversation—but in a much lower key.

"I quite understand, Mr. Bethune," he said, so
that she should not overhear, "what you wrote to
me—that the bringing out of such a volume will
require time, and expense.  And—and you must
allow me to join in, in the only way I can.  Now
what sum——?"

He hesitated.  Mr. Bethune said—

"Whatever your lordship pleases."

The young man went into the front portion of
the long apartment (where his friend was still
discreetly standing behind the window curtains) and
opened a despatch-box and sat down.  He drew out
a cheque for £50, enclosed it in an envelope, and,
coming back, slipped it into the old man's hands.

"I hope that will help; and I shall be glad to
hear of the progress of the work."

"I thank your lordship," Mr. Bethune said,
without any obsequiousness, or profusion of gratitude.

And then he turned to his granddaughter.

"Maisrie!"

The girl came away at once.  She bowed to
Lord Musselburgh in passing, without lifting her
eyes.  He, however, put out his hand, and said
"Good-bye!"  Nay, more than that, although he
had previously rang the bell, he accompanied
them both downstairs, and stood at the door while
a four-wheeled cab was being called for them.
Then, when they had left, he returned to the room
above, and called lightly to his friend who was
still standing at the window:

"Ready, Vin?  Come along, then!  Did you
hear the old man and his poetry?—a harmless
old maniac, I think.  Well, let's be off to Victoria;
we'll get down to the Bungalow in time for a
good hour's lawn-tennis before dinner."

Meanwhile old George Bethune and his granddaughter
were being driven away eastward in the
cab; and he was chatting gaily to her, with the air
of one who had been successful in some enterprise.
He had doffed his Scotch plaid; and, what is more,
he had also abandoned the Scotch accent in which
he had addressed 'his loardship.'  It was to be a
great book, this collection of Scotch-American
poetry.  It would enable him to pay a well-deserved
compliment to many an old friend of his
in Toronto, in Montreal, in New York.  He was
warm in his praises of this young Lord Musselburgh;
and predicted a great future for him.
Then he put his head out of the window and bade
the driver stop—opposite the door of a
wine-merchant's office.

"Grandfather," said the girl, "may I wait for
you in the cab?"

"Certainly not," he answered with decision.  "I
wish you to see men and things as part of your
education.  Live and learn, Maisrie—every moment
of your life."

Leaving the Scotch plaid in the cab, he crossed
the pavement and went into the office, she meekly
following.  The wine-merchant was sent for, and
presently he made his appearance.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Glover," old George
Bethune said, with something of an air of quiet
patronage, "I wish to order some claret from you."

The tall, bald, bland-looking person whom he
addressed did not seem to receive this news with
any joy; but the young lady was there, and he
was bound to be courteous; so he asked
Mr. Bethune to be kind enough to step into the
back-premises where he could put some samples before
him.  Maisrie was for remaining where she stood;
but her grandfather bade her come along; so she
also went with them into the back portion of the
establishment, where she was accommodated with
a chair.  At this table there were no illustrated
books to which she could turn; there were only
bottles, glasses, corkscrews, and a plateful of
wine-biscuits; so that she kept her eyes fixed on the
floor—and was forced to listen.

"Claret, Mr. Glover," said the old man, with
a certain sententiousness and assumption of
importance that he had not displayed in speaking to
Lord Musselburgh, "claret was in former days the
national drink of Scotland—owing to the close
alliance with France, as you know—and the old
Scotch families naturally preserve the tradition.
So that you can hardly wonder if to one of the
name of Bethune a sound claret is scarcely so much
a luxury as a necessity.  Why, sir, my ancestor,
Maximilien de Bethune, duc de Sully, had the
finest vineyards in the whole of France; and it was
his privilege to furnish the royal table——"

"I hope he got paid," the bland wine-merchant
said, with a bit of a laugh; but happening to
glance towards the young girl sitting there, and
perceiving that the pale and beautiful face had
suddenly grown surcharged with colour, he,
instantly, and with the greatest embarrassment,
proceeded to stumble on—

"Oh, yes, of course," he said, hastily: "a great
honour—naturally—the royal table—a great honour
indeed—I quite understand—the duc de Sully, did
you say?—oh, yes—a great statesman——"

"The greatest financier France has ever possessed,"
the old man said, grandly.  "Though he was by
profession a soldier, when he came to tackle the
finances of the country, he paid off two hundred
millions of livres—the whole of the king's debts, in
fact—and filled the royal treasury.  It is something
to bear his name, surely; I confess I am proud of
it; but our family goes far further back than the
duc de Sully and the sixteenth century.  Why,
sir," he continued, in his stately manner, "when the
royal Stewarts were known only by their office—*Dapifer*
or *Seneschallus* they were called—the
Beatons and Bethunes could boast of their
territorial designation.  In 1434, when Magister John
Seneschallus, Provost of Methven, was appointed
one of the Lords Auditors, it was Alexander de
Beaton who administered the oath to him—the
same Alexander de Beaton who, some two years
thereafter, accompanied Margaret of Scotland to
France, on her marriage with the Dauphin.  Yes,
sir, I confess I am proud to bear the name; and
perhaps it is the more excusable that it is about
the last of our possessions they have left us.
Balloray——"  He paused for a second.  "Do you
see that child?" he said, pointing with a trembling
forefinger to his granddaughter.  "If there were
any right or justice, there sits the heiress of
Balloray."

"It was a famous lawsuit in its time," the
wine-merchant observed—but not looking in Maisrie's
direction.

"It killed my father, and made me a wanderer on
the face of the earth," the old man said; and then
he raised his head bravely.  "Well, no matter;
they cannot rob me of my name; and I am
Bethune of Balloray—whoever has the wide lands."

Now perhaps there still dwelt in the breast of
the suave-looking wine-merchant some remorse of
conscience over the remark that had caused this
pale and sensitive-looking young creature to flush
with conscious shame; at all events he had quite
abandoned the somewhat grudging coldness with
which he had first received his customer; and when
various samples of claret had been brought from
the cellar and placed on the table, it was the more
expensive that he frankly and fully recommended.
Nay, he was almost pressing.  And again he called
to his assistant, and bade him fetch a particular
bottle of champagne; and when that was opened,
he himself poured out a glass and offered it to the
young lady, with a biscuit or two, and seemed
concerned and distressed when she thanked him and
declined.  The end of this interview was that old
George Bethune ordered a considerable quantity of
claret; and carried away with him, for immediate
use, a case of twelve bottles, which was put into the
four-wheeled cab.

Park Street, Mayfair, occupies a prominent
position in the fashionable quarter of London; but
from it, at intervals, run one or two smaller
thoroughfares—sometimes ending in stables—the dwellings
in which are of a quite modest and unpretentious
appearance.  It was to one of these smaller
thoroughfares that George Bethune and his
granddaughter now drove; and when they had entered
the quiet little house, and ascended to the first
floor, they found that dinner was laid on the table,
for the evening was now well advanced.  When they
were ready, the frugal banquet was also ready; and
the old man, seated at the head of the table, with
Maisrie on his right, soon grew eloquent about the
virtues of the bottle of claret which he had just
opened.  The girl—who did not take any wine—seemed
hardly to hear.  She was more thoughtful
even than usual—perhaps, indeed, there was a trace
of sadness in the delicate, pensive features.  When
the fresh-coloured servant-lass brought in the
things, and happened to remain in the room for a
second or two, Maisrie made some pretence of
answering her grandfather; then, when they were
left alone again, she relapsed into silence, and let
him ramble on as he pleased.  And he was in a
satisfied and garrulous mood.  The evening was fine
and warm—the window behind them they had left
open.  He approved of the lodging-house cookery;
he emphatically praised the claret, with the
conviction of one who knew.  Dinner, in fact, was half
way over before the girl, looking up with her
beautiful, clear, limpid eyes—beautiful although
they were so strangely wistful—ventured to say
anything.

"Grandfather," she asked, with obvious hesitation,
"did—did Lord Musselburgh—give you—something
towards the publication of that book?"

"Why, yes, yes, yes, certainly," the old man said,
with much cheerfulness.  "Certainly.  Something
substantial too.  Why not?"

The hot blood was in her face again—and her
eyes downcast.

"Grandfather," she said, in the same low voice,
"when will you set about writing the book?"

"Ah, well," he made answer, evasively, but with
perfect good humour, "it is a matter to be thought
over.  Indeed, I heard in New York of a similar
volume being got together; but I may be first in
the field after all.  There is no immediate hurry.
A thing of that kind must be thought over and
considered.  And indeed, my dear, I cannot go back
to America at present; for my first and foremost
intention is that you should begin to learn
something of your native country.  You must become
familiar with the hills and the moorlands, with the
roaring mountain-torrents, and the lonely islands
amid the grey seas.  For of what account is the
accident of your birth?  Omaha cannot claim you.
There is Scotch blood in your veins, Maisrie—the
oldest in the land; and you must see Dunfermline
town, where the King sate 'drinking the blood-red
wine'; and you must see Stirling Castle, and
Edinburgh, and Holyrood, and Melrose Abbey.
Nebraska has no claim over you—you, a Bethune of
Balloray.  And you have some Highland blood in
your veins too, my dear; for if the Grants who
intermarried with the Bethunes were not of the
northern Grants whose proud motto is 'Stand fast,
Craigellachie!' none the less is Craig-Royston wild
and Highland enough, as I hope to show you some
day.  And Lowland or Highland, Maisrie, you must
wear the snood when you go north; a young Scotch
lass should wear the snood; yes, yes, the bit of blue
ribbon will look well in your hair.  Melrose," he
rambled on, as he filled his glass again, "and
Maxwellton Braes; Yarrow's Banks; and fair Kirkconnel
Lea: a storied country: romance, pathos, tragic and
deathless music conjured up at every footstep.
Instead of the St. Lawrence, you shall have the
murmur of the Tweed: instead of Brooklyn—the
song-haunted shores of Colonsay!  But there is one
place that with my will you shall never visit—no,
not while there are strangers and aliens there.  You
may wander all over Scotland—north, south, east,
and west—but never, never while I am alive, must
you ask to see 'the bonny mill-dams o' Balloray.'"

She knew what he meant; she did not speak.
But presently—perhaps to draw away his thoughts
from that terrible law-suit which had had such
disastrous consequences for him and his—she said—

"I hope, grandfather, you won't think of remaining
in this country on my account.  Perhaps it is
better to read about those beautiful places, and to
dream about them, than to see them—you remember
'Yarrow Unvisited.'  And indeed, grandfather, if
you are collecting materials for that book, why
should we not go back at once?  It would be
dreadful if—if—the other volume were to come out
first—and you indebted to Lord Musselburgh, or
any one else; but if yours were written and
published—if you could show them you had done what
you undertook to do, then it would be all perfectly
right.  For you know, grandfather," she continued,
in a gently persuasive and winning voice, "no one
could do it as well as you!  Who else has such a
knowledge of Scotland and Scottish literature, or
such a sympathy with Scottish music and poetry?
And then your personal acquaintance with many of
those writers—who used to welcome you as one of
themselves—who else could have that?  You could
do it better than any one, grandfather; and you
have always said you would like to do something
for the sake of Scotland; and here is the very thing
ready to your hand.  Some other time, grandfather,"
she pleaded, with those beautiful clear eyes turned
beseechingly upon him, "some other time you will
take me to all those beautiful places.  It is not as
if I had come back home; I have hardly ever had
a home anywhere; I am as well content in
Montreal or Toronto as anywhere else.  And then you
could get all the assistance you might need over
there—you could go to your various friends in the
newspaper offices, and they would give you information."

"Yes, yes; well, well," he said, peevishly; "I
am not a literary hack, to be driven, Maisrie.  I
must have my own time.  I made no promise.
There, now, get me my pipe; and bring your
violin; and play some of those Scotch airs.  Yes,
yes; you can get at the feeling of them; and that
comes to you through your blood, Maisrie—no
matter where you happen to be born."

Twilight had fallen.  At the open window, with
a long clay pipe, as yet unlit, in his fingers, old
George Bethune sate and stared out into the
semi-darkness, where all was quiet now, for the carriages
from the neighbouring mews had long ago been
driven away to dinner-parties and operas and
theatres.  And in the silence, in the dusky part
of the room, there arose a low sound, a
tender-breathing sound of most exquisite pathos, that
seemed to say, as well as any instrument might say—

   |  "I'm wearin' awa', Jean,
   |  Like snaw-wreaths in thaw, Jean,
   |  I'm wearin' awa',
   |  To the land o' the leal;
   |  There's nae sorrow there, Jean,
   |  There's neither cauld nor care, Jean,
   |  The day's aye fair
   |  In the land o' the leal."
   |

Most tenderly she played, and slowly; and with
an absolute simplicity of tone.

"There's Scotch blood in your veins, Maisrie—Scotch
blood," he said, approvingly, as the
low-vibrating notes ceased.

And then again in the darkness another plaintive
wail arose—it was the Flowers o' the Forest this
time—and here the old man joined in, singing in a
sort of undertone, and with a sufficiently
sympathetic voice:

   |  "I've heard the liltin' at our yowe-milkin',
   |    Lasses a-liltin, before the dawn o' day;
   |  But now there's a moanin' on ilka green loanin';
   |    The Flowers o' the Forest are a' wede away.
   |
   |   \*      \*      \*      \*      \*
   |
   |  "We hear nae mair liltin' at our yowe-milkin',
   |    Women and bairns are dowie and wae;
   |  Sighin' and moanin', on ilka green loanin'—
   |    The Flowers o' the Forest are a' wede away."
   |

"Yes, yes," he said, as he rose and came away
from the window, "it is the Scotch blood that
tingles, it is the Scotch heart that throbs.  'Yestreen,
when to the trembling strings, the dance gaed
through the lichted ha'——'  Who but a Scotchman
could have written that?  Well, now, Maisrie,
we'll have the gas; and you can get out the spirits;
and we'll try some of the livelier airs.  There's
plenty of them, too, as befits a daring and energetic
people—a nation of fighters.  They were not always
bewailing their losses in the field."  And therewith
the old man, pacing up and down before the empty
fire-place, began to sing, with upright head and
gallant voice—

   |  "London's bonnie woods and braes,
   |    I maun leave them a', lassie;
   |  Wha can thole when Britain's faes
   |    Would gie Briton law, lassie?
   |  Wha would shun the field o' danger?
   |    Wha to fame would live a stranger?
   |  Now when freedom bids avenge her,
   |    Wha would shun her ca', lassie?"
   |

Maisrie Bethune had laid aside her violin; but
she did not light the gas.  She stood there, in the
semi-darkness, in the middle of the room, timidly
regarding her grandfather, and yet apparently
afraid to speak.  At last she managed to say—

"Grandfather—you will not be angry—?"

"What's this, now?" he said, wheeling round
and staring at her, for the peculiarity of her tone
had caught his ear.

"Grandfather," she continued, in almost piteous
embarrassment.  "I—I wish to say something to
you—I have been thinking about it for a long
while back—and yet afraid you mightn't
understand—you might be angry—"

"Well, well, what is it?" he said, impatiently.
"What are you dissatisfied with?  I don't see that
you've much to complain of, or I either.  We don't
live a life of grandeur; nor is there much
excitement about it; but it is fairly comfortable.  I
consider we are very well off."

"We are too well off, grandfather," she said, sadly.

He started at this, and stared at her again.

"What do you mean?"

"Grandfather," she said, in the same pathetic
voice, "don't you see that I am no longer a child?
I am a woman.  And I am doing nothing.  Why
did you give me so careful an education if I am not
to use it?  I wish to earn something—I—I wish
to keep you and me, grandfather—"

The stammering sentences ceased: he replied
slowly, and perhaps a trifle coldly.

"Why did I have you carefully educated?  Well,
I should have thought you might have guessed—might
have understood.  But I will tell you.  I
have given you what education was possible in our
circumstances in order to fit you for the station
which some day you may be called upon to fill.
And if not, if it is fated that injustice and iniquity
are to be in our case perpetual, at all events you
must be worthy of the name you bear.  But it was
not as an implement of trade," he continued, more
warmly, "that I gave you such education as was
possible in our wandering lives.  What do you
want to do?  Teach music?  And you would
use your trained hand and ear—and your trained
soul, which is of more importance still—to drum
mechanical rudiments into the brats of some
bourgeois household?  A fit employment for a
Bethune of Balloray!"

She seemed bewildered—and agonised.

"Grandfather, I must speak!  I must speak!
You may be angry or not—but—but I am no longer
a child—I can see how we are situated—and—and
if it is pride that causes me to speak, remember who
it is that has taught me to think of our name.
Grandfather, let us begin a new life!  I can
work—I am old enough to work—I would slave my
fingers to the bone for you!  Grandfather, why
should you accept assistance from any one?—from
Lord Musselburgh or any one?  No, I do not
blame you—I have always thought that everything
you did was right—and kind and good; but I cannot
be a child any longer—I must say what I think and
feel.  Grandfather——"

But here the incoherent appeal broke down; she
fell on her knees before him, and clasped her hands
over her face; and in the dark the old man—stern
and immovable—could hear the sound of her violent
sobbing.

"I will work—oh, I will work night and day,
grandfather," she continued, wildly, "if only you
will take my money and not from any one else!  I
will go on the stage—I will turn dressmaker—I
will go anywhere or do anything—and work hard
and hard—if only you will consent!  There would
not be so much sacrifice, grandfather—a little, not
much—and don't you think we should be all the
happier?  I have spoken at last, grandfather—you
will forgive me!  I could not keep silent any
longer.  It has been weighing on my heart—and
now—now you are going to say yes, grandfather—and
to-morrow—to-morrow we begin differently.
We are so much alone—let us live for each other—let
us be independent of every one!  Now you are
going to say yes, grandfather—and indeed, indeed
I will work for both of us, oh, so gladly!——"

"Have you finished?" he asked.

She rose, and would have seized his hand to
enforce her appeal, but he withdrew a step, and
motioned her to be seated.

"I am glad of this opportunity," he said, in a
formal and measured fashion.  "You say you have
become a woman; and it is natural you should begin
and think for yourself; hitherto I have treated you
as a child, and you have obeyed and believed
implicitly.  As for your immediate wish, I may say
at once that is impossible.  There is no kind of work
for which you are fitted—even if I were prepared to
live on your earnings, which I am not.  The stage?
What could you do on the stage!  Do you think an
actress is made at a moment's notice?  Or a
dress-maker either?  How could you turn dressmaker
to-morrow?—because you can hem handkerchiefs?
And as for making use of your education, do you
know of the thousands of girls whose French and
Italian and music are as good as yours, and who can
barely gain their food by teaching?——"

He altered his tone; and spoke more proudly.

"But what I say is this, that you do not
understand, you have not yet understood, my position.
When George Bethune condescends to accept
assistance, as you call it, he receives no favour, he
confers an honour.  I know my rights, and stand on
them; yes, and I know my wrongs—and how trifling
the compensations ever likely to be set against them.
You spoke of Lord Musselburgh; but Lord
Musselburgh—a mushroom peer—the representative of a
family dragged from nothingness by James VI.—Lord
Musselburgh knew better than you—well he
knew—that he was honouring himself in receiving
into his house a Bethune of Balloray.  And as for
his granting me assistance, that was his privilege,
his opportunity, his duty.  Should not I have done
the like, and gladly, if our positions had been
reversed?  *Noblesse oblige*.  I belong to his
order—and to a family older by centuries than his.  If
there was a favour conferred to-day at Musselburgh
House, it was not on my shoulders that it fell."

He spoke haughtily, and yet without anger; and
there was a ring of sincerity in his tones that could
not be mistaken.  The girl sate silent and abashed.

"No," said he, in the same proud fashion;
"during all my troubles, and they have been more
numerous than you know or need ever know, I have
never cowered, or whimpered, or abased myself
before any living being.  I have held my head up.
My conscience is clear towards all men.  'Stand
fast, Craig-Royston!' it has been with me—and
shall be!"

He went to the window and shut it.

"Come, light the gas, Maisrie; and let us talk
about something else.  What I say is this, that if
anyone, recognising the injustice that I and mine
have suffered, should feel it due to himself, due to
humanity, to make some little reparation, why, that
is as between man and man—that ought to be
considered his privilege; and I take no shame.  I
ask for no compassion.  The years that I can hope
for now must be few; but they shall be as those
that have gone before.  I abase myself before no
one.  I hold my head erect.  I look the world in
the face; and ask which of us has the greater cause
to complain of the other.  'Stand fast,
Craig-Royston!'—that has been my motto; and so, thank
God, it shall be to the end!"

Maisrie lit the gas, and attended to her
grandfather's other wants—in a mechanical sort of way.
But she did not take up the violin again.  There
was a strangely absent look on the pale and beautiful
and pensive face.

The young man whom Lord Musselburgh had
hailed came into the middle of the room.  He was
a handsome and well-made young fellow of about
three or four-and-twenty, with finely-cut and
intelligent features, and clear grey eyes that had a
curiously straightforward and uncompromising look
in them, albeit his manner was modest enough.  At
the present moment, however, he seemed somewhat
perturbed.

"Who were those two?" he said, quickly.

"Didn't you listen while the old gentleman was
declaiming away?" Lord Musselburgh made
answer.  "An enthusiastic Scot, if ever there was
one!  I suppose you never heard of the great
Bethune lawsuit?"

"But the other—the girl?"

"His granddaughter, I think he said."

"She is the most beautiful human creature I
ever beheld!" the young man exclaimed, rather
breathlessly.

His friend looked at him—and laughed.

"That's not like you, Vin.  Take care.  The
Hope of the Liberal Party enmeshed at
four-and-twenty—that wouldn't do!  Pretty—oh, yes, she
was pretty enough, but shy: I hardly saw anything
of her.  I dare say her pretty face will have to be
her fortune; I suspect the poor old gentleman is
not overburdened with worldly possessions.  He
has his name, however; he seems proud enough
of that; and I shouldn't wonder if it had made
friends for him abroad.  They seem to have travelled
a good deal."

While he was speaking his companion had
mechanically lifted from the table the card which
old George Bethune had sent up.  The address
in Mayfair was pencilled on it.  And mechanically
the young man laid down the card again.

"Well, come along, Vin—let's get to Victoria."

"No, if you don't mind, Musselburgh," said the
other, with downcast eyes, and something of
embarrassment, "I would rather—not go down to the
Bungalow to-night.  Some other time—it is so
good of you to be always asking me down——"

"My dear fellow," the young nobleman said,
looking at his friend curiously, "what is the matter
with you?  Are you in a dream?  Are you asleep?
Haven't I told you that —— is coming down by
a late train to-night; and isn't all the world
envying you that the great man should make such a
protégé and favourite of you?  Indeed you must
come down; you can't afford to lose such a chance.
We will sit up for him; and you'll talk to him during
supper; and you'll listen to him for hours after
if he is in the humour for monologues.  Then
to-morrow morning you'll take him away bird's-nesting—he
is as eager for any new diversion as a school-boy;
and you'll have him all to yourself; and one
of these days, before you know where you are, he'll
hand you a Junior Lordship.  Or is it the
Under-Secretaryship at the Home Office you're waiting
for?  You know, we're all anxious to see how the
new experiment will come off.  The young man
unspoiled by Oxford or Cambridge—untainted by
landlord sentiment—trained for public life on first
principles: one wants to see how all this will work
in practice.  And we never dictate—oh, no, we
never dictate to the constituencies; but when the
public notice from time to time in the newspapers
that Mr. Vincent Harris was included in ——'s
dinner-party on the previous evening, then they
think; and perhaps they wonder when that lucky
young gentleman is going to take his seat in the
House of Commons.  So really, my dear Vin, you
can't afford to throw away this chance of having
—— all to yourself.  I suppose he quite
understands that you are not infected with any of your
father's Socialistic theories?  Of course it's all
very well for an enormously rich man like your
father to play with Communism—it must be an
exciting sort of amusement—like stroking a tiger's
tail, and wondering what will happen in
consequence; but you must keep clear of that kind
of thing, my boy.  Now, come along——"

"Oh, thank you, Musselburgh," the young man
said, in the same embarrassed fashion, "but if
you'll excuse me—I'd rather stay in town to-night."

"Oh, very well," the other said, good-naturedly,
"I shall be up in a day or two again.  By the way,
the Four-in-Hand Club turns out on Saturday.
Shall I give you a lift—and we'll go down to
Hurlingham for the polo?  Mrs. Ellison is coming."

"Oh, thanks—awfully good of you—I shall be
delighted," the young man murmured; and a few
seconds thereafter the two friends had separated,
Lord Musselburgh driving off in a hansom to
Victoria-station.

This young Vincent Harris who now walked away
along Piccadilly towards Hyde Park was in a sort
of waking trance.  He saw nothing of the people
passing by him, nor of the carriages, nor of the
crowd assembled at the corner of the Row, expecting
the Princess.  He saw a pale and pathetic face, a
dimly-outlined figure standing by a table, a chastened
splendour of girlish hair, an attitude of meekness
and diffidence.  Once only had he caught a glimpse
of the beautiful, clear, blue-grey eyes—when she
came in at the door, looking startled almost; but
surely a man is not stricken blind and dumb by
a single glance from a girl's wondering or enquiring
eyes?  Love at first sight?—he would have
dismissed the suggestion with anger, as an
impertinence, a profanation.  It was not love at all:
it was a strange kind of interest and sympathy she
had inspired—compassionate almost, and yet more
reverent than pitiful.  There appeared to be some
mysterious and subtle appeal in her very youth:
why should one so young be so solitary, so timid,
sheltering herself, as it were, from the common
gaze?  Why that touch of pathos about a mouth
that was surely meant to smile?—why the lowered
eyelashes?—was it because she knew she was alone
in this great wilderness of strangers, in this teeming
town?  And he felt in his heart that this was not
the place for her at all.  She ought to have been
away in sunny meadows golden with buttercups,
with the laughter of young children echoing around
her, with the wide air fragrant with the new-mown
hay, with thrushes and blackbirds piping clear from
amidst the hawthorn boughs.  Who had
imprisoned this beautiful child, and made a white
slave of her, and brought her into this great
roaring market of the world?  And was there no
one to help?

But it was all a perplexity to him; even as was
this indefinable concern and anxiety about one to
whom he had never even spoken a word.  What
was there in that pensive beauty that should so
strangely trouble him?  She had made no appeal
to him; their eyes could scarcely be said to have
met, even in that brief moment; her cruel fate, the
tyranny of her surroundings, her pathetic resignation,
were all part and parcel of a distracted reverie,
that seemed to tear his heart asunder with fears,
and indignation, and vows of succour.  And
then—somehow—amidst this chaos and bewilderment—his
one desire was that she should know he wished
to be her friend—that some day—oh, some wild
white day of joy!—he should be permitted to take
her hand and say "Do not be so sad!  You are not
so much alone.  Let me be by your side for a little
while—until you speak—until you tell me what I
can do—until you say 'Yes, I take you for my
friend!'"

He had wandered away from the fashionable
crowd—pacing aimlessly along the unfrequented
roadways of the Park, and little recking of the
true cause of the unrest that reigned in his bosom.
For one thing, speculations about love or marriage
had so far concerned him but slightly; these things
were too remote; his aspirations and ambitions were
of another sort.  Then again he was familiar with
feminine society.  While other lads were at college,
their thoughts intent on cricket, or boating, or golf,
he had been kept at home with masters and teachers
to fit him for the practical career which had been
designed for him; and part of the curriculum was
that he should mix freely with his kind, and get to
know what people of our own day were thinking, not
what people of two thousand years ago had been
thinking.  One consequence of this was that 'Vin'
Harris, as he was universally called, if he did not
know everything, appeared to know everybody; and
of course he was acquainted with scores on scores
of pretty girls—whom he liked to look at when, for
example, they wore a smart lawn tennis costume,
and who interested him most perhaps when they
were saucy; and also he was acquainted with a
considerable number of young married ladies, who were
inclined to pet him, for he was good-natured, and
easy-mannered, and it may be just a little careless
of their favour.  But as for falling seriously in love
(if there were such a thing) or perplexing himself
with dreams of marriage—that was far from his
scheme of life.  His morning companions were
Spencer, Bain, John Mill, Delolme, Hallam,
Freeman, and the like; during the day he was busy with
questions relating to food supply, to the influence of
climate on character, the effect of religious creeds
on mental development, the protection and
cultivation of new industries, and so forth; then in the
evening he was down at the House of Commons a
good deal, especially when any well-known orator
was expected to speak; and again he went to all
kinds of social festivities, particularly when these
were of a political cast, or likely to be attended by
political people.  For Vin Harris was known to be
a young man of great promise and prospects; he
was received everywhere; and granted a consideration
by his elders which was hardly justified by his
years.  That he remained unspoiled—and even
modest in a degree unusual at his age—may be put
down to his credit, or more strictly to the fortunate
accident of his temperament and disposition.

How long he walked, and whither he walked, on
this particular evening, he hardly knew; but as
daylight waned he found himself in Oxford-street,
and over there was Park-street.  Well enough he
remembered the address pencilled on the visiting-card;
and yet he was timorous about seeking it out;
he passed and went on—came back again—glanced
nervously down the long thoroughfare—and then
resumed his aimless stroll, slowly and reluctantly.
To these indecisions and hesitations there came the
inevitable climax: with eyes lowered, but yet
seeming to see everything around him and far
ahead of him, he went down Park-street until he
came to the smaller thoroughfare named on the
card; and there, with still greater shamefacedness,
he paused and ventured to look at the house that he
guessed to be the abode of the old man and his
granddaughter.  Well, it was a sufficiently humble
dwelling; but it was neat and clean; and in the
little balcony outside the first floor were a number
of pots of flowers—lobelias, ox-eye daisies, and
musk.  The window was open, but he could hear
nothing.  He glanced up and down the small street.
By this time the carriages had all been driven away
to dinner-party and theatre; a perfect silence
prevailed everywhere; there was not a single
passer-by.  It was a quiet corner, a restful haven, these
two lonely creatures had found, after their varied
buffetings about the world.  And to this young
man, who had just come away from the roar of
Oxford-street and its surging stream of human life,
there seemed something singularly fascinating and
soothing in the stillness.  He began to think that
he, too, would like to escape into this retreat.  They
would not object to a solitary companion?—to a
neighbour who would be content to see them, from
the other side of the way, at the window now and
again, or perhaps to say "Good morning!" or
"Good evening!" as they passed him on the
pavement?  He could bring his books; here would be
ample opportunity for study; there were far too
many distractions and interruptions at his father's
house.  And then—after weeks and weeks of
patient waiting—then perhaps—some still
evening—he might be invited to cross over?  In the
hushed little parlour he would take his
seat—and—oh! the wonder and enhancement of it—be
privileged to sit and listen, and hear what the wanderers,
at rest at last, had to say of the far and outer world
they had left behind them.  He did not know what
she was called; but he thought of several names;
and each one grew beautiful—became possessed of a
curious interest—when he guessed that it might be
hers.

Suddenly the silence sprung into life; some one
seemed to speak to him; and then he knew that
it was a violin—being played in that very room.
He glanced up towards the open window; he could
just make out that the old man was sitting there,
within the shadow; therefore it must be the girl
herself who was playing, in the recess of the
chamber.  And in a sort of dream he stood and
listened to the plaintive melody—hardly
breathing—haunted by the feeling that he was intruding on
some sacred privacy.  Then, when the beautiful,
pathetic notes ceased, he noiselessly withdrew with
bowed head.  She had been speaking to him, but
he was bewildered; he hardly could tell what that
trembling, infinitely sad voice had said.

He walked quickly now; for in place of those
vague anticipations and reveries, a more definite
purpose was forming in his brain; and there was
a certain joyousness in the prospect.  The very
next morning he would come up to this little
thoroughfare, and see if he could secure lodgings for
himself, perhaps opposite the house where the old
man and his granddaughter lived.  It was time he
was devoting himself more vigorously to study;
there were too many people calling at the big
mansion in Grosvenor Place; the frivolities of the
fashionable world were too seductive.  But in the
seclusion of that quiet little quarter he could give
himself up to his books; and he would know that
he had neighbours; he might get a glimpse of
them from time to time; that would lighten his
toil.  Then when Mary Bethune—he had come
to the conclusion that Mary was her name, and
had made not such a bad guess, after all—when
Mary Bethune played one of those pathetic Scotch
airs, he would have a better right to listen; he
would contentedly put down Seaman's "Progress
of Nations," and go to the open window, and sit
there, till the violin had ceased to speak.  It was a
most excellent scheme; he convinced himself that
it would work right well—because it was based on
common sense.

When he arrived at the great house in Grosvenor
Place, he went at once into the dining-room, and
found, though not to his surprise, that dinner was
just about over.  There were only three persons
seated at the long table, which was sumptuously
furnished with fruit, flowers, and silver.  At the
bead was Vin Harris's father, Mr. Harland Harris,
a stout, square-set, somewhat bourgeois-looking man,
with a stiff, pedantic, and pompous manner, who
nevertheless showed his scorn of conventionalities
by wearing a suit of grey tweed; on his right sate
his sister-in-law, Mrs. Ellison, a remarkably pretty
young widow, tall and elegant of figure, with wavy
brown hair, shrewd blue eyes, and a most charming
smile that she could use with effect; the third
member of the group being Mr. Ogden, the great
electioneerer of the north, a big and heavy man,
with Yorkshire-looking shoulders, a bald head, and
small, piggish eyes set in a wide extent of face.
Mr. Ogden was resplendent in evening dress, if
his shining shirt-front was somewhat billowy.

"What's this now?" said the pretty Mrs. Ellison
to the young man, as he came and pulled in a chair
and sate down by her.  "Haven't you had any
dinner?"

"Good little children come in with dessert," said
he, as he carelessly helped himself to some olives
and a glass of claret.  "It's too hot to eat
food—unusual for May, isn't it?  Besides I had a late
luncheon with Lord Musselburgh."

"Lord Musselburgh?" put in Mr. Ogden.  "I
wonder when his lordship is going to tell us what
he means to be—an owner of racehorses, or a
yachtsman, or a statesman?  It seems to me he can't
make up his own mind; and the public don't know
whether to take him seriously or not."

"Lord Musselburgh," said Vincent, firing up in
defence of his friend, "is an English gentleman,
who thinks he ought to support English institutions:—and
I dare say that is why he does not find
saving grace in the caucus."

Perhaps there was more rudeness than point in
this remark; but Mrs. Ellison's eyes laughed—decorously
and unobserved.  She said aloud—

"For my part, I consider Lord Musselburgh a
very admirable young man: he has offered me the
box-seat on his coach at the next Meet of the
Four-in-Hand Club."

"And are you going, aunt?" her nephew asked.

"Yes, certainly."

"Rather rash of Musselburgh, isn't it?" he
observed, in a casual sort of way.

"Why?"

"What attention is he likely to pay to his team,
if you are sitting beside him?"

"None of your impertinence, sir," said she (but
she was pleased all the same).  "Boys must not
say such things to their grandmothers."

Now the advent of Master Vin was opportune;
for Mr. Harris, finding that his sister-in-law had
now some one of like mind to talk to, left those
two frivolous persons alone, and addressed himself
exclusively to his bulky friend from the north.
And his discourse took the form of pointing out
what were the practical and definite aims that
Socialism had to place before itself.  As to general
principles, all thinking men were agreed.  Every
one who had remarked the signs of the times knew
that the next great movement in modern life must
be the emancipation of the wage-slave.  The
tyranny of the capitalist—worse than any tyranny
that existed under the feudal system—must be
cribbed and confined: too long had he gorged
himself with the fruits of the labours of his
fellow-creatures.  The most despicable of tyrants, he;
not only robbing and plundering the hapless beings
at his mercy, but debasing their lives, depriving
them of their individualism, of the self-respect
which was the birthright of the humblest
handicraftsman of the middle ages, and making of them
mere machines for the purpose of filling his pockets
with useless and inordinate wealth.  What was to
be done, then?—what were the immediate steps to
be taken in order to alter this system of monstrous
and abominable plunder.  It was all very well to
make processions to Père Lachaise, and wave red
flags, and wax eloquent over the graves of the
Communists; but there was wanted something more
than talk, something more than a tribute to the
memory of the martyrs, something actual to engage
our own efforts, if the poor man was not to be for
ever ground to the dust, himself and his starving
family, by the relentless plutocrat and his convenient
freedom of contract.  Let the State, then—that
engine of oppression which had been invented by
the rich—now see whether it could not do something
for all classes under its care: let it consider
the proletariat as well as the unscrupulous landlords
and the sordid and selfish bourgeoisie.  Already it
was working the Telegraphs, the Post Office, the
Parcels Post, the Dockyards, and Savings Banks;
and if it regulated the wages it paid by the
wage-rate of the outside market, that was because it
followed the wicked old system of unequal distribution
of profit that was soon to be destroyed.  That
would speedily be amended.  What further, then?
The land for the people, first of all.  As clear as
daylight was the right of the people to the land:
let the State assume possession, and manage it—its
mines and minerals, its agriculture, its public
grounds and parks—for the benefit of all, not for
the profit of a pampered few.  The State must buy
and own the railways, must establish Communal
centres of distribution for the purchase and
exchange of goods, must establish systems of credit,
must break down monopoly everywhere, and the
iron power of commercialism that was crushing the
life out of the masses of the population.  The State
must organise production, so that each man shall
do his share of work demanded by the community,
and no more——

But here Mrs. Ellison, who had doubtless heard or
read all this before, turned away altogether.  She
asked her nephew to give her some more strawberries.

"I say, Vin," she remarked, incidentally, "what
very beautiful dessert-plates these are.  I don't
remember them.  Where did you get them?"

"I thought you would admire them," said he.
"They are my father's own design."

"Really!  I call them very handsome—and so
quaint and unusual.  He must tell me where I
can get some of them: when I go back to Brighton
I should like to take a few with me for my small
establishment."

"But you can't, aunt," he said.

"Why?"

"Because my father had the moulds broken."

She looked at him for a moment and then
sniggered—yes, sniggered, but discreetly, so that
the two perfervid politicians should not see.

"That is pretty well," she observed in an
undertone, "for a Socialist and Communist—to have the
moulds broken so that nobody else should have any!"

Presently she said, in the same undertone—

"I'm going to catch your eye in a minute, Vin.
Are you coming upstairs to the drawing-room with me?"

"Yes, of course, aunt," said he, instantly.  "Get
up now, and let's be off."

She rose: so did her brother-in-law.  Mr. Ogden
remained in his chair—perhaps through inattention,
or perhaps he was bewildered by the consciousness
that he ought to make, as a relic of his ancient
worship of *laissez faire*, some protest against this
wholesale intervention of the State.  Then Vincent
opened the door for the tall and bright-eyed young
widow; and he and she passed out and went upstairs
together.

When they entered the spacious and richly-furnished
room, the atmosphere of which was heavy
with the scent of flowers, Mrs. Ellison seated herself
in a low lounging-chair, while her nephew stood
some little way off, his hands behind his back, his
eyes absently staring into a rose-shaded lamp as if
he could see pictures there.  When she spoke, no
doubt he heard; but he did not answer or interrupt:
he allowed her to ramble on.  And she was in a
talkative and vivacious mood.

"I'm going to the Drawing Room to-morrow,
Vin," said she, "to present Louie Drexel; and if you
were kind and civil you would come down to
St. James's Park and find out our brougham and talk
to us while we are waiting.  I do so want you to
get to know Miss Drexel well; it would be worth
your while, I can tell you.  You see, those American
girls have such excellent good sense.  This evening,
before you came in, your father was treating us to
a dissertation on the iniquity of riches—or rather
the absurdity of people revelling in wealth, and at
the same time professing to be Christians.  He
asked—and I'm sure I couldn't answer him—how
a Bishop can reconcile his enjoyment of £10,000 a
year with Christ's plain injunction, 'Sell all that
thou hast and distribute unto the poor.'  And while
I was listening to the sermon, I was thinking of you,
Vin.  I don't know how far you have accepted your
father's theories—which he himself takes precious
good care not to put into practice.  But some
day—for young men are so impulsive and wilful and
uncertain—you might suddenly take it into your head
to do some wild thing of that kind; and then don't
you see how well it would be for you to be married
to a sensible American girl; for if you were to sell
all that you have and give to the poor, she would
make pretty certain you didn't sell all that she
had—so long as the Married Women's Property Act
was in force.  There's no mad Quixotism about a
girl like that—level-headed, isn't that what they
call it over there?  Then think what a help such a
wife as that would be to you in public life.  Think
of an election, for example—why, Louie Drexel
could talk the voters out of their five senses—bamboozle
the women, and laugh the men into good
humour.  I wonder you didn't pick up one of those
bright American girls when you were over in the
States: I suppose you were too busy examining the
political machine, and the machinists.  But I'm glad
you didn't; I couldn't trust you; and I'm going to
do it for you myself.  You are my boy: I'm going
to provide for you.  And I haven't fixed on Louie
Drexel yet; but at the same time you might come
down to-morrow to St. James's Park and talk to her."

He withdrew his eyes from the crimson lamp, and
came and took a chair near her.

"I am thinking of making a little change in my
arrangements," said he.  "There is too much
distraction here; especially at this time of the year,
when everybody's in town.  I am going to take
rooms elsewhere."

"Oh, ho!" exclaimed the pretty young widow,
with a smile.  "Is that it?  The restraint of home
has been found too much at last—we must have
freedom, and wine-parties, and cards?  Well, who
can wonder at it?  I warned your father years ago
of the folly of not sending you to college; you
would have had all that over by this time, like other
young men; but no, the future Champion of the
Proletariat was not to have his mind contaminated
by the sons of squires.  Well, and where have the
princely apartments been chosen?  In Piccadilly, of
course—yellow satin and golden goblets."

"You are quite mistaken, aunt," he said, simply.
"The rooms I hope to get to-morrow are in a
quiet little street that I dare say you never heard
of: if you saw it, you might probably call it shimmy."

"Oh, is that it?" she said again, for her brain
was nimble and swift in the construction of theories.
"Then you are really going to put some of your
father's principles into practice, and to consort with
the masses?  I've often wondered when he was
going to begin himself.  You know how he declares
it to be monstrous that there should be people of
your own race, and colour, and religion, whom you
would hesitate to ask to sit down at the same table
as yourself; but I have not heard him as yet invite
Jack the crossing-sweeper or Tom from the
stable-yard to come in and dine with him.  And if they
came in without an invitation, taking him at his
word, as it were, I'm afraid their reception wouldn't
be warm—yes, it would be remarkably warm—they'd
be thrown out of the front-door in a couple of seconds.
So you are going slumming, is that it?  You want
to understand the great heart of the people—before
you lead them on to anarchy and universal plunder?"

"Aunt," said he, with a smile, "you mustn't say
such things to me; you mustn't pour reactionary
poison into my young mind.  No; I am going to
retire into that quiet little corner of London simply
to get on with my books; and as I shan't let
anybody know where it is, I can't be disturbed."

"Do you mean to live there altogether?" she
asked, glancing quickly at him.  "Shall you sleep
there?"

"Oh, no.  I shall come home here each evening."

"To dinner?  But it is no use asking you that;
for you never seem to care where you dine, or
whether you dine at all.  Have you told your
father of this scheme?"

"No, not yet," he made answer; and he could
say nothing further just then, for at this moment
Harland Harris and his guest came upstairs from the
dining-room, and Mr. Ogden proceeded to engage
the young widow in ponderous conversation.

As good luck would have it, when Vincent
went up next morning to the little thoroughfare
leading from Park-street, he found exactly the
rooms he wanted, and engaged them there and then,
paying a fortnight's rent in advance in order to
calm the good landlady's mind, for he had not a
scrap of luggage with him.  The sitting-room was
all he really required, to be sure; but he did not
wish to be disturbed by having the adjoining
bedroom occupied; so he took that too, money not
being of much consequence to this young man.
And then, when the landlady left, he sate down to
look at his new possessions.  The apartments must
have looked poorly furnished to eyes familiar with
the splendour of Grosvenor Place; but at all events
they seemed clean.  Cheap German lithographs
adorned the walls; the fireplace was gay with strips
of pink paper.  But when he approached the
window—which he did stealthily—there was more to
interest him: the opposite two windows, behind the
balcony filled with flowers, were both open: at any
moment a figure might appear there—perhaps
looking out absently and vaguely with those
beautiful and wistful eyes.  Or perchance he might hear
the tender strains of the unseen violin?  He
remained there for some time, rather breathless and
nervous, until he recollected that he had come
hither for the purposes of study; and then he
thought he would go away down to Grosvenor Place
and seek out such books and writing-materials as
he might want, and bring them along forthwith.

He went downstairs and was just about to step
outside when he caught sight of something across
the way which caused him instantly to shrink back
and shelter himself within the shadow of the
door—his heart beating quickly.  He had nearly been
face-to-face with the pensive-eyed young girl, for
she had come forth from the opposite house, and
was waiting for her grandfather to follow.  He
remained concealed—fearful of being seen, and yet
scarcely knowing why.  Then, when he heard the
door on the other side shut, and when he had allowed
them a few seconds' grace, he stepped forth from
his hiding, and saw that they were just turning the
corner into Park-street.

Why this perturbation that caused his hands to
tremble, that caused his eyeballs to throb, as he
looked and looked, and yet hardly dared to look?
He was doing no harm—he was thinking no harm.
These thoroughfares were open to all; the May
morning was warm and fine and clear; why should
not he take his way to Hyde Park as well as another?
Even in furtively watching whither they went—in
keeping a certain distance between them and
him—there was no sort of sacrilege or outrage.  If they
had turned and confronted him, they could not have
recognised him: it was almost impossible they
could have observed the young man who was half
concealed by the curtains of the room in
Musselburgh House.  And yet—yet—there was some kind
of tremulous wonder in his being so near her—in
his being allowed, without let or hindrance, to gaze
upon the long-flowing masses of hair, that caught
a sheen of light here and there, and stirred with the
stirring of the wind.  And then the simple grace
and ease of her carriage: she held her head more
erect in these quiet thoroughfares; sometimes she
turned a little to address the old man, and then her
refined and sensitive profile became visible, and also
the mysterious charm of the long and drooping
lashes.  He noticed that she never looked at any
passer-by; but she did not seem so sad on this fresh
morning; she was talking a good deal—and
cheerfully, as he hoped.  He wished for more sunlight—that
the day might brighten all around her—that
the warm airs might be sweet with the blossoms of
the opening summer.

For now they were nearing Hyde Park; and away
before them stretched the pale blue vistas of
atmosphere under the wide-swaying branches of the
maples.  They crossed to Grosvenor Gate; they
left the dull roar of Park Lane behind them; they
passed beneath the trees; and emerged upon the
open breadths of verdure, intersected by pale pink
roads.  Though summer had come prematurely,
this was almost an April-like day: there was a
south-west wind blowing, and flattening the feathery
grasses; there were shafts of misty sunlight striking
here and there; while a confusion of clouds, purple
and grey and silver, floated heavily through the
surcharged sky.  The newly-shorn sheep were quite
white—for London.  A smart young maidservant
idly shoving a perambulator had a glory of Spring
flowers in her bonnet.  The mild air blowing about
brought grateful odours—was it from the green-sward
all around, or from the more distant masses
of hawthorn white and red?

The old man, marching with uplifted head, and
sometimes swinging the stick that he carried, was
singing aloud in the gaiety of his heart, though
Vincent, carefully keeping at a certain distance,
could not make out either the words or the air.
The young girl, on the other hand, was simply
looking at the various objects, animate and
inanimate, around her—at the birds picking up straws or
shreds of wool for the building of their nests, at the
wind shivering through the grey spikelets of the
grass, at the ever-changing conformation of the
clouds, at the swaying of the branches of the trees;
while from time to time there came floating over
from Knightsbridge the sound of a military band.
No, she did not appear so sad as she had done the
day before; and there was something cheerful, too,
about her costume—about the simple dress of dark
blue-and-white-striped linen and the sailor's hat of
cream-white with a dark blue band.  Mary, he made
sure her name was—Mary Bethune.  Only a name
to him; nothing more: a strange, indefinable,
immeasurable distance lay between them; not for
him was it to draw near to her, to breathe the same
air with her, to listen to the low tones of her voice,
to wait for the uplifting of the mysteriously shaded
eyes.  And as for fancies become more wildly
audacious?—what would be the joy of any human
being who should be allowed to touch—with
trembling fingertips—with reverent and almost
reluctant fingertips—the soft splendour of that
shining and beautiful hair?

George Bethune and his granddaughter made
their way down to the Serpentine, and took their
places on a bench there, while the old man proceeded
to draw from his pocket a newspaper, which he
leisurely began to read.  The girl had nothing to
do but sit placidly there and look around her—at
the shimmering stretch of water, at the small boys
sailing their mimic yachts, at the quacking ducks
and yelping dogs, at the ever-rustling and murmuring
trees.  Vincent Harris had now dared to draw
a little nearer; but still he felt that she was worlds
and worlds away.  How many yards were there
between him and her?—not yards at all, but
infinities of space!  They were strangers to each
other; no spoken word was possible between them;
they might go through to the end of life with this
impalpable barrier for ever dividing them.  And yet
it seemed a sort of miraculous thing that he was
allowed to come so close—that he could almost tell
the individual threads of that soft-shining hair.
Then, more than once, too, he had caught a glimpse
of her raised eyes, as she turned to address her
grandfather; and that was a startling and
bewildering experience.  It was not their mere beauty;
though, to be sure, their clear and limpid deeps
seemed all the more clear and limpid because of the
touch of sun-tan on her complexion; it was rather
that they were full of all ineffable things—simplicity,
submission, gratitude, affection, and even, as he
rejoiced to think, some measure of mild enjoyment.
For the moment there was little of that pensive and
resigned look that had struck him in the figure
standing with bowed head at Lord Musselburgh's
table.  She appeared to be pleased with the various
life around her and its little incidents; she regarded
the sailing of the miniature yachts with interest.
When a brace of duck went whirring by overhead,
she followed their flight until they were lost to view;
she watched two small urchins furtively fishing for
minnows, with an eye on the distant park-keeper.
There was a universal rustling of leaves in the
silence; and sometimes, when the wind blew straight
across, the music of the military band became more
distinct.

How long they remained there, the young man
did not know; it was a golden morning, and all too
brief.  But when at last they did rise to go he was
very nearly caught; for instead of returning by the
way they had come, they struck westward; and he
suddenly saw with alarm that there was no time for
him to get behind one of the elms.  All he could
do was to turn aside, and lower his eyes.  They
passed within a few yards of him; he could
distinctly hear the old man singing, with a fine
note of bravado in his voice, "The standard on the
braes o' Mar, is up and streaming rarely"; then,
when he was sure they were some way off, he made
bold to raise his eyes again.  Had she taken any
notice of him?  He hoped not.  He did not wish
her to think him a spy; he did not wish to be
known to her at all.  He should be her constant
neighbour, her companion almost, without any
consciousness on her part.  And again and again he
marvelled that the landlady in the little thoroughfare
should have given him those treasures of
rooms—should have put such happiness within his
reach—for so trivial a sum.  Seventeen shillings a
week!—when each moment would be a diamond,
and each evening hour a string of diamonds!

But nevertheless there were his studies to be
thought of; so now he walked away down to
Grosvenor Place, gathered his books together, and
took them up in a hansom to his newly-acquired
lodgings.  That afternoon he did loyally stick to
his work—or tried to do so, though, in fact, his ears
were alert for any sound coming from the other side
of the way.  He had left his window open; one of
the windows of the opposite house was also left open.
Occasionally he would lay down Draper's Civil War
in America, and get up and stretch his legs, and
from a convenient shelter send a swift glance of
scrutiny across the street.  There was no sign.
Perhaps they had gone out again, shopping, or
visiting, or, as likely as not, to look at the people
riding and driving in the Park.  He returned to
Draper, and to President Jackson's Proclamation—but
with less of interest: his annotations became
fewer.  He was listening as well as reading.

Then all of a sudden there flashed into his brain
a suggestion—a suggestion that had little to do with
Clay's Compromise, or the project to arrest
Mr. Calhoun.  On the previous evening it had seemed
to him as though the unseen violinist were speaking
to him: why, then, should he not answer, in the
same language?  There could be no offence in
that—no impertinence: it would be merely one vague
voice responding to the other, the unknown
communicating in this fleshless and bloodless way with
the unknown.  And now he was abundantly grateful
to his aunt for having insisted on his including
music among his various studies and accomplishments:
a use had come for his slight proficiency at
last: most modern languages he knew, but he had
never expected to be called upon to speak in this
one.  And yet what more simple, as between
neighbours?  He was not thrusting his society on any
one; he was invading no privacy; he was demanding
no concession of friendship or even acquaintance.
But at least the dreadful gulf of silence would be
bridged over by this mystic means.

It was nearly six o'clock; London was busy when
he went out on this hot evening.  He walked along
to a music-publisher's place in Regent-street; and
hired a piano on the express stipulation that it was
to be in his rooms within one hour.  Then, as he
had only had a biscuit for lunch, and wished to
leave himself untrammelled later on, he turned into
a restaurant, and dined there, simply enough, and
had a cigarette and a look at the evening papers.
Thereafter he strolled back to his lodgings, and took
to his book, though his thoughts were inclined to
wander now and again.

Twilight had fallen; but he did not light the gas.
Once, for a brief second or two, he had quietly run
his fingers over the keys of the piano, to learn if it
was tolerably in tune; then the room relapsed into
silence again.  And was there to be silence on the
other side as well?  He waited and listened, and
waited and listened, in vain.  Perhaps, while he was
idling away his time in the Regent-street restaurant,
they had come out from the house and gone off to
some theatre.  The street was so still now that he
could almost have heard any one speaking in that
room on the other side; but there was no sound.

Then his heart leapt and his brain grew giddy.
Here was that low-breathing and vibrating wail
again:—and was she alone now?—in the gathering
darkness?  He recognised the air; it was "Auld
Robin Gray;" but never before had he known that
it was so beautiful and so ineffably sad as well.
Slowly she played and simply; it was almost like
a human voice; only that the trembling strings had
a penetrating note of their own.  And when she
ceased, it seemed to him that it would be profanation
to break in upon the hushed and sacred stillness.

And yet was he not to answer her, in the only
speech that could not offend?  Was he to act the
coward, when there offered a chance of his
establishing some subtle link with, her, of sending a
message, of declaring his presence in this surely
unobtrusive fashion?  Quickly he sat down to the
piano; and, in rather a nervous and anxious fashion,
began.  He was not a brilliant performer—anything
but that; but he had a light touch and a sensitive
ear; and he played with feeling and grace.  It was
"Kathleen Mavourneen"—and a sort of appeal in
its way, did she but remember the words.  He
played the melody over only once, slowly and as
sympathetically as he could; then he rose and
retired from the piano; and stood in the darkness,
listening.

Alas! there was no response.  What had he
done?  He waited, wondering; but all was still
in the little street.  It was as if some bird, some
mellow-throated thrush or nightingale, had been
warbling to itself in the dim security of the
leaves, and been suddenly startled and silenced
by an alien sound, not knowing what that might
portend.

   AN APPROACH.

There was a knock at the door.

"Come in!" called out old George Bethune.

There appeared a middle-aged man, of medium
height, who looked like a butler out of employment;
he was pale and flabby of face, with nervous eyes
expressive of a sort of imbecile amiability.

"Ah, Hobson!" said Mr. Bethune, in his lofty
manner.  "Well?"

The landlady's husband came forward in the
humblest possible fashion; and his big, prominent,
vacuous eyes seemed to be asking for a little
consideration and goodwill.

"I beg your pardon, sir," said he, in the most
deplorable of Cockney accents, "I 'umbly beg your
pardon for making so bold; but knowing as you
was so fond of everything Scotch, I took the liberty
of bringing you a sample of something very special—a
friend of mine, sir, recommended it—and then says
I to him, 'Lor bless ye, I don't know nothing about
Highland whiskey; but there's a gentleman in our
'ouse who is sure to be a judge, and if I can persuade
him to try it, he'll be able to say if it's the real sort.'"

"All right, Hobson," said George Bethune, in his
grand way.  "Some other time I will see what it is
like."

"Thank you, sir, thank you!" said the
ex-butler, with earnest gratitude; and he went and
placed the bottle on the sideboard.  Then he came
back, and hesitatingly took out an envelope from
his pocket.  "And if I might ask another favour,
sir.  You see, sir, in this 'ot weather people won't
go to the theatres; and they're not doing much;
and my brother-in-law, the theatrical agent, he's
glad to get the places filled up, to make a show, sir,
as you might say.  And I've got two dress-circle
seats, if you and the young lady was thinking of
going to the theatre to-morrow night.  It's a great
favour, sir, as my brother-in-law said to me as he
was a-giving me the tickets and arsking me to get
'em used."

He lied; for there was no brother-in-law and no
theatrical agent in the case.  He himself had that
very afternoon honestly and straightforwardly
purchased the tickets at the box-office, as he had
done on more than one occasion before, out of
the money allowed him for personal expenses by
his wife; so that he had to look forward to a
severe curtailment of his gin and tobacco for weeks
to come.

"Thanks—thanks!" said George Bethune, as he
lit his long clay pipe.  "I will see what my
granddaughter says when she comes in—unless you
would like to use the tickets yourself."

"Oh, no, sir, begging your pardon, sir," was the
instant rejoinder.  "When I 'ave a evening out I
go to the Oxbridge music-'all—perhaps it's vanity,
sir—but when Charley Coldstream gets a hangcore,
I do like to hear some on 'em call out, 'Says
Wolseley, says he!'  Ah, sir, that was the proudest
moment of my life when I see Charley Coldstream
come on the stage and begin to sing verse after
verse, and the people cheering; and I owed it all
to you, sir; it was you, sir, as advised me to send it
to him——"

"A catching refrain—a catching refrain," said
the old gentleman, encouragingly.  "Just fitted to
get hold of the public ear."

"Why, sir," said Hobson, with a fatuous little
chuckle of delight, "this werry afternoon, as I was
coming down Park-street, I 'eard a butcher's boy
a-singing it—I did indeed, sir—as clear as could be
I 'eard the words,

   |      'Says Wolseley, says he,
   |      To Arabi,
   |  You can fight other chaps, but you can't fight me.'

—every word I 'eard.  But would you believe it,
sir, when I was in the Oxbridge music-'all I could
'ardly listen, I was so frightened, and my ears
a-buzzin, and me 'ardly able to breathe.  Lor, sir,
that was a experience!  Nobody looked at me,
and that was a mercy—I couldn't ha' stood it.
Even the chairman, as was not more than six
yards from me, 'e didn't know who I was, and not
being acquainted with him, I couldn't offer him
somethink, which I should have considered it a
proud honour so to do on sich an occasion.  And
if I might make so bold, sir——"

He was fumbling in his breast-pocket.

"What—more verses?" said Mr. Bethune, good-naturedly.
"Well, let's see them.  But take a seat,
man, take a seat."

Rather timidly he drew a chair in to the table;
and then he said with appealing eyes:

"But wouldn't you allow me, sir, to fetch you a
little drop of the whiskey—I assure you it's the best!"

"Oh, very well—very well; but bring two
tumblers; single drinking is slow work."

In a few seconds those two curiously-assorted
companions—the one massive and strong-built,
impressive in manner, measured and emphatic of
speech, the other feeble and fawning, at once eager
and vacuous, his face ever ready to break into a
maudlin smile—were seated in confabulation
together, with some sheets of scribbled paper between.

"And if you will excuse my being so bold, sir,"
continued Hobson, with great humility, "but I
'ave been reading the little volume of Scotch
songs you lent me, and—and——"

"Trying your hand at that, too?"

"Only a verse, sir."

Mr. Bethune took up the scrap of paper; and
read aloud:

   |  "O leese me on the toddy,
   |                 the toddy,
   |                 the toddy,
   |  O leese me on the toddy,
   |  We'll hae a willie-waught!"
   |

"Well, yes," he said, with rather a doubtful air,
"you've got the phrases all right—except the
willie-waught, and that is a common error.  To
tell you the truth, my friend, there is no such
thing as a willie-waught.  *Waught* is a hearty
drink; a richt gude-willie waught is a drink with
right good will.  *Willie-waught* is nothing—a
misconception—a printer's blunder.  However, phrases
do not count for much.  Scotch phrases do not
make Scotch song.  It is not the provincial dialect—it
is the breathing spirit that is the life"—and
therewith he repeated, in a proud manner, as if to
crush this poor anxious poet by the comparison,

   |  "I see her in the dewy flower,
   |  Sae lovely, sweet, and fair;
   |  I hear her voice in ilka bird
   |  Wi' music charm the air;
   |  There's not a bonnie flower that springs
   |  By fountain, shaw, or green,
   |  Nor yet a bonnie bird that sings
   |  But minds me o' my Jean."
   |

"Beg pardon, sir—Miss Bethune?" said Hobson,
enquiringly; for he evidently thought these lines
were of the old gentleman's own composition.  And
then, as he received no answer, for Mr. Bethune
had turned to his pipe, he resumed, "Ah, I see, sir,
I 'ave not been successful.  Too ambitious—too
ambitious.  It was you yourself, sir, as advised me
to write about what I knew; and—and in fact, sir,
what I see is that there is nothing like patriotism.
Lor, sir, you should see them young fellers at the
Oxbridge—they're as brave as lions—especially
when they've 'ad a glass.  Talk about the French!
The French ain't in it, when we've got our spirit
up.  We can stand a lot, sir, yes, we can; but don't
let them push us too far.  Not *too* far.  It will be
a bad day for them when they do.  An Englishman
ain't given to boasting; but he's a terror when his
back's up—and a Scotchman too, sir, I beg your
pardon—I did not mean anything—I intended to
include the Scotchman too, I assure you, sir.
There's a little thing here, sir," he continued
modestly, "that I should like to read to you, if I
may make so bold.  I thought of sending it to
Mr. Coldstream—I'm sure it would take—for there's
some fight in the Englishman yet—and in the
Scotchman too, sir," he instantly added.

"A patriotic poem?—Well?"

Thus encouraged the pleased poet moistened his
lips with the whiskey and water he had brought for
himself and began—

   |  "*Where's the man would turn and fly?*
   |  *Where's the man afraid to die?*
   |  *It isn't you, it isn't I.*
   |  *No, my lads, no, no!*"

Then his voice had a more valiant ring in it still:

   |  "*Who will lead us to the fray?*
   |  *Who will sweep the foe away?*
   |  *Who will win the glorious day?*
   |    *Of England's chivalry?*"

It is true he said, "Oo will sweep the foe awye?"
but these little peculiarities were lost in the fervour
of his enthusiasm.

   |  "*Roberts—Graham—Buller—Wood—*"

He paused after each name as if listening for the
thunderous cheering of the imaginary audience.

   |  "And many another 'most as good:
   |  They're the men to shed their blood
   |    For their country!"

Then there was a touch of pathos:

   |  "*Fare thee well, love, and adieu!*"

But that was immediately dismissed:

   |  "*Fiercer thoughts I have than you;*
   |  *We will drive the dastard crew*
   |    *Into slavery!*"

And then he stretched forth his right arm, and
declaimed in loud and portentous tones—

   |  "*See the bloody tented-field;*
   |  *Look the foe—they yield!—they yield!*
   |  *Hurrah! hurrah! our glory's sealed!*
   |  *Three cheers for victory!*"
   |

Suddenly his face blanched.  For at this moment
the door opened: a tall woman appeared—with
astonishment and indignation only too legible in
her angular features.

"Hobson!" she exclaimed; and at this awful
sound the bold warrior seemed to collapse into a
limp rag.  "I am surprised—I am *indeed* surprised!
Really, sir, how can you encourage him in such
impudence?  Seated at your own table and drinking
too, I declare," she went on, as she lifted up the
deserted tumbler—for her bellicose husband had
hastily picked up his MSS. and vanished from the
room.  "Really, sir, such familiarity!"

"In the republic of letters, my good Mrs. Hobson,"
said Mr. Bethune with a smile, "all men are
equal.  I have been much interested in some of
your husband's writings."

"Oh, sir, don't put sich things in his 'ead!" she
said, as she proceeded to lay the cloth for dinner.
"He's a fool, and that's bad enough; but if so
be as you put things in his 'ead, and he giving
of hisself airs, it'll be hawful!  What good he is to
anybody, I don't know.  He won't clean a winder
or black a boot even."

"How can you expect it?" George Bethune said,
in perfect good humour.  "Manual labour would
be a degradation.  Men of genius ought to be
supported by the State."

"In the workus, I suppose," she said, sharply—but
here Maisrie Bethune came upstairs and into
the room, carrying some parcels in her hand, and
instantly the landlady's face changed its expression,
and became as amiable and smiling as the gaunt
features would allow.

At dinner the old man told his granddaughter
that he had procured (he did not say how) places at
the —— Theatre for the following evening, and
seemed to be pleased about this little break in their
quiet lives.

"But why did you go to such expense,
grandfather?" Maisrie said.  "You know I am quite
happy enough in spending the evening at home
with you.  And every day now I ask myself when
I am to begin copying the poems—for the volume,
you know.  You have sent for them to America,
haven't you?  But really you have such a wonderful
memory, grandfather, I believe you could repeat
them all—and I could write them down—and let
the printers have them.  I was so glad when you
let me help you with the book you published in
Montreal; and you know my writing is clear
enough; you remember what the foreman printer
said?  Don't you think we could begin to-night,
grandfather?  It pleases you to repeat those
beautiful verses—you are so fond of them—and proud of
them because they are written by Scotchmen—and
I am sure it would be a delight to me to write
them out for you."

"Oh, yes, yes," he said, fretfully, "but not
to-night.  You're always in such a hurry, Maisrie."  And
then he added, in a gentler way, "Well, it is
a wonderful blessing, a good memory.  I never
want for a companion, when I've a Scotch air or a
Scotch song humming through my brain.  On the
darkest and wettest day, here in this big city, what
have you to do but think of

   |  'The broom, the yellow, yellow broom,
   |  The broom o' the Cowdenknowes,'

and at once you have before you golden banks, and
meadows, and June skies, and all else is forgotten.
Indeed, lass, Scotland has become for me such a
storehouse of beautiful things—in imagination—that
I am almost afraid to return to it, in case
the reality might disappoint me.  No, no, it
could not disappoint me: I treasure every inch
of the sacred soil: but sometimes I wonder if you
will recognise the magic and witchery of hill and
glen.  As for me, there is naught else I fear now;
there are no human ties I shall have to take up
again; I shall not have to mourn the 'Bourocks o'
Bargeny.'"

"What is that, grandfather?"

"If you had been brought up in Scotland, Maisrie,
you would know what the bigging o' bourocks
is among children—play-houses in the sand.
But sometimes the word is applied to huts or
cottages, as it is in the title of Hugh Ainslie's
poem.  That poem is one that I shall be proud to
give a place to in my collection," he continued,
with an air of importance.  "Hugh Ainslie is no
more with us; but his countrymen, whether in
America or at home, are not likely to forget the
'Bourocks o' Bargeny.'"

"Can you remember it, grandfather?"

"Can I not?" said he; and therewith he repeated
the lines, never faltering once for a phrase—

   |  "I left ye, Jeanie, blooming fair
   |  'Mang the bourocks o' Bargeny;
   |  I've found ye on the banks o' Ayr,
   |  But sair ye're altered, Jeanie.
   |  I left ye like the wanton lamb
   |  That plays 'mang Hadyed's heather;
   |  I've found ye noo a sober dame—
   |  A wife and eke a mither.

   |  I left ye 'mang the leaves sae green
   |  In rustic weed befittin';
   |  I've found ye buskit like a queen,
   |  In painted chaumer sittin'.
   |  Ye're fairer, statelier, I can see,
   |  Ye're wiser, nae doubt, Jeanie;
   |  But oh!  I'd rather met wi' thee
   |  'Mang the bourocks of Bargeny!"
   |

"It's very sad, grandfather," she said, wistfully.

"The way of the world—the way of the world,"
said he; and observing that she had finished and
was waiting for him, he forthwith rose and went to
the mantelpiece for his pipe.  "There's many a
true story of that kind.  Well, Maisrie, you'll just
get your violin, and we'll have the 'Broom o' the
Cowdenknowes?'"  And while she went to fetch
the violin, and as he cut his tobacco, he sang in a
quavering voice—

   |  "O the broom, the bonnie, bonnie broom,
   |    The broom o' the Cowdenknowes,
   |  I wish I were at hame again
   |    Where the broom sae sweetly grows!"

And then he went to the window, to smoke his pipe
in peace and quiet, while Maisrie, seated further
back in the shadow of the room, played for him the
well-known air.  Did she guess—and fear—that
she might have an audience of more than one?  At
all events her doubts were soon resolved: when she
had ceased, and after a second or so of silence,
there came another sound into the prevailing
hush—it was one of the Songs without Words, and it
was being played with considerable delicacy and
charm.

"Hallo," said Mr. Bethune, when he heard the
first low-rippling notes, "have we a musical
neighbour now?"

"Yes, grandfather," Maisrie replied, rather
timidly.  "Last night, when you were out, some
one played."

"Ah, a music-mistress, I dare say.  Poor thing—perhaps
all alone—and wishing to be friendly in
this sort of fashion."

They listened without further speech until the
last notes had gradually died away.

"Now, Maisrie, it is your turn!"

"Oh, no, grandfather!" she said, hastily.

"Why not?"

"It would be like answering—to a stranger."

"And are we not all strangers?" he said, gently.
"I think it is a very pretty idea, if that is what is
meant.  We'll soon see.  Come, Maisrie; something
more than the plashing of a southern fountain—something
with northern fire in it.  Why not
'Helen of Kirkconnell'?"

The girl was very obedient; she took up her
violin; and presently she was playing that strangely
simple air that nevertheless is about as proud and
passionate and piteous as the tragic story to which
it is wedded.  Perhaps the stranger over there did
not know the ballad; but George Bethune knew
it only too well; and his voice almost broke into
a sob as he said, when she had finished—

"Ah, Maisrie, it was no music-master taught you
that; it was born in your nature.  Sometimes I
wonder if a capacity for intense sympathy means an
equal capacity for suffering; it is sad if it should be
so; a thick skin would be wholesomer—as far as I
have seen the world; and few have seen more of it.
Well, what has our neighbour to say?"

Their unseen companion on the other side of the
little thoroughfare responded with a waltz of
Chopin's—a mysterious, elusive sort of a thing,
that seemed to fade away into the dark rather than
to cease.  Maisrie appeared disinclined to continue
this *do ut des* programme; but her grandfather
overruled her; and named the airs for her to play, one
by one, in alternation with those coming from the
open window opposite.  At last she said she was
tired.  It was time for the gas to be lit, and the hot
water brought up for her grandfather's toddy.  So
she closed the window and pulled down the blind;
lit up the room; rang the bell for the hot water;
and then placidly sate down to her knitting, whilst
her grandfather, brewing himself an unmistakable
gude-willie waught, and lighting another pipe,
proceeded to entertain her with a rambling
disquisition upon the world at large, but especially
upon his own travels and experiences therein, his
philosophical theories, and his reminiscences of the
Scotch countryside ballads of his youth.

That mystic and enigmatic conversation with
their neighbour over the way was not continued on
the following evening, for the old man and his
granddaughter went to the theatre; but on the
next night again it was resumed; and thereafter,
on almost every evening, the two windows
replied to each other, as the twilight deepened into
dusk.  And Maisrie was less reluctant now—she
almost took this little concert *à deux* as a matter of
course.  For one thing, the stranger, whoever he or
she might be, did not seem in any way anxious to
push the acquaintance any further; no one ever
appeared at that open window; nor had she ever
encountered any one coming out as she stood on the
doorstep waiting for her grandfather.  As for him,
he still maintained that the new occupant of those
rooms must be a woman—perhaps some shy
creature, willing to think that she had friendly
neighbours, and yet afraid to show herself.  Besides, the
music that came in response to Maisrie's Scotch airs
was hardly what a man would have chosen.  The
stranger over there seemed chiefly fond of
Mendelssohn, Chopin, and Mozart; though occasionally
there was an excursion into the *Volkslieder* domain—"*Zu
Strassburg auf der Schanz*," "*Es ritten drei
Reiter zum Thore hinaus*," "*Von meinetn Bergli muss
i scheiden*," or something of that kind; whereas,
if it had been a man who occupied those rooms,
surely they would have heard—during the day, for
example—a fine bold ditty like "Simon the
Cellarer," "The Bay of Biscay," or "The Friar of
Orders Gray," with a strident voice outroaring the
accompaniment?  Maisrie answered nothing to
these arguments; but in spite of herself, when she
had to cross the room for something or other, her
eyes would seek that mysteriously vacant window,
with however rapid and circumspect a glance.  And
always in vain.  Moreover, the piano was never
touched during the day: the stranger invariably
waited for the twilight before seeking to resume
that subtle link of communication.

Of course this state of things could not go on for
ever—unless the person over there possessed the
gift of invisibility.  One morning as Maisrie and her
grandfather were going out as usual for a stroll in
the Park, she went downstairs first, and along the
lobby, and opened the door, to wait for him.  At
the very same instant the door opposite was opened,
and there, suddenly presented to her view, was a
young man.  He was looking straight across; she
was looking straight across; their eyes met without
the slightest chance of equivocation or denial; and
each knew that this was recognition.  They regarded
each other but for a swift second; but as plainly as
possible he had said to her "Do you guess?  Are
you angry?  No, do not be angry!"—and then his
glance was averted; he shut the door behind him;
and slowly proceeded on his way.  Was she
surprised?  No.  Perhaps she was startled by the
unexpectedness of the meeting; perhaps her heart
was beating a little more quickly than usual; but a
profound instinct had already told her that it was
no woman who had spoken to her in those dusky
twilights, evening after evening.  A woman would
not have wrapped herself up in that mysterious
secrecy.  A woman who wished to make friends
with her neighbours over the way would have come
to the window, would have smiled, would have made
some excuse for calling.  Maisrie did not ostensibly
look after the young man—but she could see him
all the same, until he turned the corner.  She was
vaguely troubled.  The brief glance she had met
had in it a kind of appeal.  And she wished to say
in return that she was not offended; that, being
strangers, they must remain strangers; but that she
had not taken his boldness ill.  She wished to
say—she did not know what.  Then her grandfather came
down; and they went away together; but she
uttered not a syllable as to what had just occurred.
It was all a bewilderment to her—that left her a
little breathless when she tried to think of it.

That night, when the customary time arrived, she
refused to take up her violin; and when her
grandfather remonstrated, she had no definite excuse.
She hesitated and stammered—said they had not
played chess for ever so long—or would he rather
have a game of draughts?—anything but the violin.

"Are you forgetting your good-natured neighbour
over there?" her grandfather asked.  "It will be
quite a disappointment for her.  Poor thing, it
appears to be the only society she has; we never
hear a sound otherwise; there seems to be no one
ever come to talk to her during the day, or we
should hear a voice now and again."

"Yes, but, grandfather," said Maisrie, who seemed
much embarrassed, "don't you think it a little
imprudent to—to encourage this kind of—of
answering each other—without knowing who the
other person is?"

"Why, what can be more harmless!" he
protested, cheerfully, and then he went on: "More
harmless than music?—nothing, nothing!  Song is
the solace of human life; in joy it is the natural
expression of our happiness—in times of trouble it
refreshes the heart with thoughts of other and
brighter days.  A light heart—a heart that can
sing to itself—that is the thing to carry you
through life, Maisrie!"  And he himself, as he
crossed the room to fetch a box of matches, was
trolling gaily, with a fine bravura execution—

   |  "The boat rocks at the pier o' Leith,
   |    Fu' loud the wind blows frae the ferry;
   |  The ship rides by the Berwick Law,
   |    And I maun leave my bonnie Mary."
   |

Maisrie was not to be moved; but she appeared
down-hearted a little.  As time went on the silence
in the little street seemed somehow to accuse her;
she knew she was responsible.  She was playing
draughts with her grandfather, in a perfunctory sort
of way.  She remembered that glance of appeal—she
could not forget it—and this had been her
answer.  Then all of a sudden her hand that
hovered over the board trembled, and she had
almost dropped the piece that was in her fingers:
for there had sprang into the stillness a half-hushed
sound—it was an air she knew well enough—she
could almost recognise the words—

   |  "*Nachtigall, ich hör' dich singen;*
   |  *S'Herz thut mir im Leibe springen,*
   |  *Komm nur bald und sag mir's wohl,*
   |  *Wie ich mich verhalten soll.*"
   |

Her grandfather stopped the game to listen; and
when the soft-toned melody had ceased, he said——

"There, now, Maisrie, that is an invitation: you
must answer."

"No, no, grandfather," she said, almost in
distress.  "I would rather not—you don't know—you
must find out something about—about whoever it is
that plays.  I am sure it will be better.  Of course
it is quite harmless, as you say—oh, yes, quite
harmless—but I should like you to get to know
first—quite harmless, of course—but I am
frightened—about a stranger—not frightened, of
course—but—don't ask me, grandfather!"

Well, it was not of much concern to him; and as
he was winning all along the line, he willingly
returned to the game.  It had grown so dark,
however, that Maisrie had to go and light the
gas—having drawn down the blinds first, as was her
invariable habit.  When she came back to the
table she seemed to breathe more freely; though
she was thoughtful and pre-occupied—not with the
game.  The music on the other side of the way
was not resumed that evening, as far as they could
hear.

Several days passed; and each evening now was
silent.  Maisrie saw nothing more of the young
man; indeed, she studiously refrained from glancing
across to the other side of the street—except when
she was going out, and wanted to make sure there
was no one there.  But something was now about
to happen that entirely altered this disposition of
affairs.

One morning George Bethune and his granddaughter
had gone for their accustomed stroll in
Hyde Park, and in course of time had taken their
places on a bench near the Serpentine, while the
old man had pulled out a newspaper and began to
read it.  The day was sultry, despite an occasional
stirring of wind; and Maisrie sitting there, and
having nothing to do but look at the water, and the
trees, and the sky, observed that all the world
around them was gradually growing darker.  In the
south, especially, the heavens were of a curious
metallic hue—a livid grey, as it were; while across
that hung two horizontal belts of deepest purple
that remained motionless, while other and lighter
tags of vapour were inter-twisting with each other
or melting away into nothingness.  Those two clouds
were not of the usual cloud-form at all—they were
rather like two enormous torpedoes lying one above
the other; and there was a sombre deadness of hue
about them that looked ominous.  Suddenly, as she
was thus vaguely regarding those long purple
swathes, there ran across them—springing vertically
upwards—a quivering line of yellow flame—so thin
it was, it appeared like a thread of golden wire—and
when that had vanished, there was a second or
two of silence, followed by a dull, low, rumbling
noise that seemed to come from a considerable
distance.  She was not much alarmed.  There were
no signs of a terrific thunderstorm; probably a few
more flashes would serve to loosen and disperse
those lowering clouds, and allow the day to clear.

It was at this moment that a young man came
up and addressed Mr. Bethune—with a certain
courteous hesitation, and yet in frank and ingenuous
tones.

"I beg your pardon, sir," said he, "but may I
claim the privilege of a neighbour to offer you this
umbrella—I'm afraid there's a shower coming—and
the young lady may get wet."

It was a pleasant voice; George Bethune looked
up well-disposed towards the stranger, whoever he
might be.  And the face of the young man was
also prepossessing; it was something more than
handsome; it was intelligent and refined; and the
honest and straightforward eyes had a certain
confidence in them, as if they were not used to having
their friendly advances repulsed.

"I thank you—I thank you," said George
Bethune, with much dignity.  "I had not observed.
But you will want the umbrella for yourself—we
can get shelter under one of the trees."

"Would that be wise, sir, in a thunderstorm?"
said the young man.  "Oh, no, let me give you
the umbrella—I don't mind a shower—and it won't
be more than that, I fancy."

George Bethune accepted the proffered courtesy.

"Here, Maisrie, since this young gentleman is so
kind; you'd better be prepared.  A neighbour did
you say, sir?" he continued.

"A very near neighbour," answered the young
man, with a smile, and he seated himself by the
side of Mr. Bethune without more ado.  "I have
often thought of speaking to you, and asking to be
allowed to make your acquaintance; for you seem
to have very few visitors—you will pardon my
curiosity—while I have none at all."

"Oh, really, really," the old man said, somewhat
vaguely; perhaps he was wondering how so faultlessly
attired a young gentleman (his patent-leather
boots, for example, were of the most approved
pattern) should have chosen lodgings in so
humble a thoroughfare.

"It is a very quiet little corner, is it not?" the
young man said—almost as if answering that
unspoken question.  "That is why it suits me so well;
I can get on with my books without interruption.
The street is so small that it isn't worth an
organ-grinder's while to waste time in it."

"Music is a sad thing for interrupting study; I
know that," the old gentleman observed.  "By the
way, I hope we do not disturb you—my granddaughter
plays the violin sometimes—"

"I could listen to that kind of music all day
long," was the response.  "I never heard such
violin-playing—most beautiful!—most beautiful!"

"Then you are not far away from us?"

"Right opposite," was the straightforward answer.

George Bethune glanced at the young man with
a look of quiet amusement; he was thinking of
the pale music-mistress—the solitary widow of his
imagination.

"And you—you also play a little in the evenings
sometimes?"

"I hope you didn't think it rude, sir," the young
man said, humbly.  "I thought it permissible, as
between neighbours."

"Oh, they were pretty little concerts," said
George Bethune, good-naturedly.  "Very pretty
little concerts.  I don't know why they were
stopped.  I suppose Maisrie had some fancy about
them—my granddaughter Maisrie—"

It was a kind of introduction.  The young man,
modestly veiling the quick flash of delight in his
eyes at this unexpected happiness, respectfully
bowed.  Maisrie, with her beautiful pale face
suffused with unusual colour, made some brief
inclination also; then she seemed to retire again
from this conversation—though she could not but
overhear.

"My name is Harris," the young man said, as
though these confidences were all as a matter of
course between neighbours.  "It isn't a very
distinguished name; but one has to take what is given
one.  It is not of much consequence."

"I am not so sure about that," the older man
rejoined, somewhat sententiously.  "A good name
is a good thing; it is an honour not to be purchased.
It may be the only one of your possessions remaining
to you; but of that they cannot rob you."

"Oh, of course, of course," Vincent said, quickly,
for he perceived the mistake he had made.  "An
old historic name is certainly something to be
proud of.  By the way, sir, did your family
originally take their name from Bethon on the
Sarthe or from Bethune in the Department of Calais?"

"Bethune—Bethune," said the old man, who
appeared to be pleased by this question, which
spoke of previous enquiries; and then he added,
with a lofty air: "The Duc de Sully, Marquis de
Rosny, Sovereign Prince of Enrichemont and
Boisbel, Grand Master of the Artillery and Marshal of
France, was Maximilien de Bethune—Maximilien
de Bethune."

"Oh, really," said the young man, who seemed
much impressed.

"The name," continued old George Bethune, in
the same oracular vein, "was often spelt Beaton and
Beton—especially in Scotland—as everybody knows.
Whether James, Archbishop of Glasgow, and his
nephew David, Archbishop of St. Andrews, had any
immediate relationship with France—beyond that
David was consecrated Bishop of Mirepoix when he
was negotiating the marriage of James V. at the
French Court—I cannot at the moment precisely
say; but of this there can be no doubt, that from
Bethune in the north came the original territorial
designation of the family, not from Bethon in the
west.  Maximilien de Bethune—Bethune in the
Department of the Straits of Calais."

"Oh really," the young man said again, quite humbly.

Now by this time it had become manifest that
there was to be no thunderstorm at all.  There had
been a few more of those quivering strokes of yellow
fire (that dwelt longer on the retina than in the
clouds) accompanied by some distant mutterings
and rumblings; and at one point it seemed as if the
dreaded shower were coming on; but all passed off
gradually and quietly; the sky slowly brightened;
a pale sunshine began here and there to touch the
greensward and the shivering elms.  This young
man had no excuse for remaining here; but he
seemed to forget; he was so busy talking—and
talking in a very pleased and half-excited fashion,
with an occasional glance across at the young lady.

"Grandfather," said Maisrie Bethune, presently,
handing him the umbrella as a sort of hint.

But even when Vincent received his property back,
he appeared to take no heed.  He had observed
that the newspaper lying on the old man's knee
was the *Toronto Globe*; he drew attention to the
circumstance; and now all his conversation was of
Queen's Park, Lake Ontario, of King Street, Queen
Street, Church Street, of the Exhibition Grounds, of
Park Island, and Block House Bay, and the Royal
Canadian Yacht Club.  So he had been there too?
Oh, yes, he had been all over Canada and America.
He was as familiar with Idaho as with Brooklyn.
He had fished in the Adirondacks and shot mountain
sheep in the Rockies.

"You have been to Omaha, then?" the old man asked.

"Oh, yes, of course."

"For my granddaughter here," he continued, with
a smile, "is an Omaha girl."

"Oh, indeed," said Vincent, rather breathlessly,
and again he ventured to look across to Maisrie
Bethune and her downcast eyes.

"Yes, but only by the accident of birth," said
George Bethune, instantly, as if he must needs
guard against any misapprehension.  "Every drop
of blood in her veins is Scotch—and of a right good
quality too.  Well, you have heard—you have
heard.  Do you think any one could understand
those old Scotch airs who was not herself Scotch in
heart and soul?"

"I never heard anything so beautiful," the young
man answered, in an undertone; indeed, he seemed
hardly capable of talking about her, any more than
he could fix his eyes steadily on her face.  His
forced glances were timorous and fugitive.  There
was something sacred—that kept him at a distance.
It was enough to be conscious that she was there;
his only prayer was that she should remain; that
he and she should be together, if a little way apart,
looking at the same skies and water and trees,
breathing the same air, hearkening to the same
sounds.  So he kept on talking to the old man, in
rather a nervous and eager fashion, fearful all the
time that either of them should propose to go.

And thus it came about that Vincent Harris
seemed to have a good deal to say for himself; he
appeared to forget that he was speaking to two
strangers; rather he was chatting with two
neighbours, whom he wished to be his friends.  And the
old man, in his self-sufficient and dignified way, was
quite content to encourage this new acquaintance.
His conversation was something to pass the time
withal; he was modest, well-mannered, intelligent;
there was an air of distinction about him that
showed good up-bringing as well as some decision
of character.  No doubt he was of a wealthy family,
or he could not have spent so much of his time in
travel; by accident he had mentioned one or two
well-known people as though he were in the habit
of familiarly meeting with them; from some
passing hint as to the nature of his studies, Mr. Bethune
gathered that this pleasant-spoken, pleasant-smiling
neighbour was destined for a public career.  There
was even something interesting, to one who had
grown old and callous of the world's shows, in
noting the bright enthusiasm of the young man, the
clear light in his eyes, the general air of strength
and ease and courage that sate lightly on him, as
befitting one who was in the very May-morn of his
youth.

But at last, for shame's sake, Vincent had himself
to rise and break up this all too-attractive
companionship.  He said, with great humility:

"I am sure I ought to apologise to Miss Bethune
for having taken up so much of your time.  Rather
an unwarrantable intrusion; but I don't think there
is any chance of the rain coming now—and—and—so
I will say good-bye."

"Good-bye—glad to have made your acquaintance,"
said old George Bethune, with a grave
courtesy.

And Maisrie made him a little bow—for he was
looking at her rather supplicatingly—as he raised
his hat and withdrew.  Their eyes had met once
more: she could not well have avoided that.  And
of course she saw him as he walked away southward,
across the bridge, until he disappeared.

"A very agreeable young man, that," said Mr. Bethune,
with decision, as he rose to his feet and
intimated to his granddaughter that they had better
set forth again.  "Frank in manner, gentle,
courteous, intelligent, too—very different from most of
the young men of the day."

His granddaughter was silent as she walked by
his side.

"What—don't you think so, Maisrie?" he said,
with a touch of impatience, for he was used to her
assent.

"I think," she answered, a little proudly, "that
he showed a good deal of confidence in coming to
speak to you without knowing you; and as for his
playing those airs in the evening, and in such a
way—well, I don't like to use the word
impertinence—but still——"

He was surprised; perhaps a trifle vexed.

"Impertinence?  Nonsense!  Nonsense!  Frankness
and neighbourliness—that was all; no intrusion,
none: a more modest young man I have never
met.  And as for his coming up to speak to me,
why, bless my life, that merely shows the humanizing
effects of travel.  It is like people meeting at
a table d'hôte; and what is the world but a big
table d'hôte, where you speak with your neighbour
for a little while, and go your way, and forget him?
Confidence?—impertinence?—nonsense!  He was
natural, unaffected, outspoken, as a young man
should be: in fact, I found myself on such friendly
terms with him that I forgot to thank him for the
little service he did us—did you, I should say.
Bashfulness, Maisrie," he continued, in his more
sententious manner, "bashfulness and stiffness are
among the worst characteristics of the untravelled
and untaught.  Who are we—whatever may be our
lineage and pride of birth—that we should fence
ourselves round with a palisade of suspicion or
disdain?"

And thus he went on; but he met with no
response.  And he did not like it; he grew all the
more emphatic about this young man; and even
hinted that women were curiously perverse creatures,
who evinced no toleration, or sympathy, or good
nature in their judgment of their fellow beings.
What was her objection?  To his appearance?—he
was remarkably good-looking, and refined in aspect,
without a trace of effeminacy.  To his manner?—he
was almost humble in his anxiety to please.  To
his talk?—but he had shown himself most bright,
good-humoured, alert, and well-informed.

"He had no right to come up and speak to you,
grandfather," was all she would say, and that with
a quite unusual firmness.

In the evening, after dinner, when the time came
at which Maisrie was accustomed to take up her
violin, there was obviously a little embarrassment.
But George Bethune tried to break through that by
a forced display of geniality.

"Come, now, Maisrie," said he, in a gay fashion,
"our neighbour over the way was straightforward
enough to come up and offer us his hand; and we
must return the compliment.  One good turn
deserves another.  Get your violin, and play
something: he will understand."

"Grandfather, how can you ask me?" she said,
almost indignantly; and there was that in the tone
of her voice that forbade him to press her further.

But perhaps the universal stillness that prevailed
thereafter conveyed some kind of reproach to her;
or perhaps her heart softened a little; at all events
she presently said, in rather a low voice, and with a
diffident manner—

"Grandfather, if you—if you really think the
young gentleman wished to be kind and obliging—and—and
if you would like to show him some little
politeness in return—couldn't you step across the
way—and—and see him, and talk to him for a few
minutes?  Perhaps he would be glad of that, if he
is quite alone."

"A capital idea, Maisrie," the old man said,
rising at once.  "A capital idea."  And then he
added, with an air of lofty complacency and
condescension, as he selected a couple of volumes from
a heap of books on the sideboard: "Perhaps I
might as well take over the *Mémoires* with me; it
is not at all unlikely he may wish to know
something further about Maximilien de Bethune.  I am
not surprised—not at all surprised—that a young
man called Harris should perceive that there is
something in the grandeur of an old historical name."

But on this particular evening, as it happened,
Vincent had promised to dine at home; for his
aunt was returning to Brighton on the following
day; and there was to be a little farewell banquet
given in her honour.  Of course aunt and nephew
sate together; Mrs. Ellison had arranged that;
knowing that at these semi-political dinner-parties
the company was frequently a trifle mixed, she took
care that on one side at least she should have a
pleasant neighbour.  And indeed when the guests
had taken their places—there were about thirty in
all—the table presented a pretty sight.  From end
to end it was a mass of flowers; at intervals there
were pyramids of ice, draped with roses, blush-red
and yellow; but the candles in the tall candelabra
were not lit—the softly-tinted globes of the electric
light shed a sufficient and diffused lustre.  It was a
sumptuous entertainment; and yet there prevailed
an air of elegance and refinement.  When soup was
served, it was not the aldermanic turtle, but a clear
golden fluid with gems of crimson and green; and
it was handed round in silver dishes.  No one thought
of a thick soup on this hot June night.

As soon as the hum of conversation became
general, the tall and handsome young widow turned
to her companion—who was only a year or two her
junior, by the way—and with her demure and
mischievous eyes grown full of meaning she said—

"Vin, what has happened to you to-day?"

"What do you mean, aunt?" he answered, with
some surprise.

"Something has happened to you to-day," she
went on, confidently.  "You can't hoodwink me.
Why have you been so radiant, so complaisant,
this afternoon—why are you here, for example—when
you haven't shown up at this dinner-table for
weeks past?"

"And you going away to-morrow, aunt!" he
exclaimed.

"No use, Vin.  All of a sudden you want to be
magnanimous to the whole human race; your
amiability becomes almost burdensome; your
eyes are full of pride and joy; and you think you
can hide the transformation from me!  Well, then,
I will tell you, since you won't tell me: to-day you
were introduced to her."

He was startled—and no wonder: had his aunt,
by some extraordinary chance, witnessed that
interview in Hyde Park?  Mrs. Ellison's shrewd,
quick eyes noticed his alarm, and laughed.

"The story is as clear as noonday," she continued,
in the same undertone.  "You come home every
night between nine and ten.  Why?  Because she
is an actress, playing in the first piece only; and
of course the theatre loses its attraction for you the
moment she has left.  Now, my dear Vin, that is
not the kind of thing for you at all!  You'd better
stop it—even although you have experienced the
wild joy of being introduced to her.  What do you
know about her?  You have been investing her
with all the charming qualities of her stage
heroines; you haven't learnt yet that she is a little
slatternly in her dress, that her tastes in eating and
drinking are rather coarse, that her tastes in
literature and art aren't any—worse still, that she
is already provided with a husband, a lounger about
Strand public-houses, only too ready to accept your
patronage and the price of a glass of gin—"

He was immensely relieved.

"Oh, you're all wrong, aunt!" he said, cheerfully.
"I haven't been inside a theatre for six months!"

"You haven't?" she said, glancing at him with a
kind of amused suspicion.  "You are really playing
the good boy with Parliamentary reports and blue
books?  A very admirable diligence.  Other young
men would be strolling in the Park, in this hot
weather."  And then all of a sudden she asked:
"What subject were you studying to-day, Vin?"

"Thompson's Distribution of Wealth," he made
answer, with equal promptitude.

"Oh.  What does he say?"

"You don't want to know, aunt!"

"Yes, I do: I'm used to hearing all sorts of
theories at this table—though I seldom see them
put in practice."

Well, he on his side was glad enough to get away
from that other and dangerous topic; and whether
or not he believed in her innocent desire for
knowledge, he began to discourse on the possibility of
universal human happiness being reached by a
voluntary equality in the distribution of the products
of labour.

"Voluntary, do you see, aunt?—that is the very
essence of the scheme," he rambled on, while she
appeared to be listening gravely.  "Thompson will
have nothing to do with force; he himself points
out that if you once bring in force to redress the
inequalities of wealth, you leave it open for every
succeeding majority to employ the same means, so
that industry would be annihilated: the capitalists
would not lend, the workers would not work.  No,
it is all to be done by mutual consent.  Those who
have wealth at present are not to be disturbed;
what they have amassed is but a trifle compared
with what the millions can produce; and it is this
product of universal co-operation that is to constitute
the real wealth of the world.  Well, I suppose it is
only a dream," he proceeded.  "On the other hand,
take my father's way of looking at it.  He is all for
State interference; the State is to appropriate
everything and manage everything; and to keep on
managing it, I suppose, or else things would revert
to their former condition.  That's where the trouble
comes in, of course.  The moment you allow
anything like freedom of contract, how can you prevent
the former condition of affairs coming into existence
again?  You know, after all, aunt, there is generally
a reason for the institutions and social arrangements
of any country; they don't spring out of nothing;
they grow, and their growth is a necessity—"

"Vincent Harris," said the young widow,
solemnly, "I perceive the seeds of a rabid Toryism
beginning to sprout in your young mind.  Wouldn't
your father say that the reason for the monstrous
condition of affairs now existing—I don't consider
them monstrous; not I; I'm pretty well content,
thank you—but wouldn't he say the reason was
simply the ignorance of the people who produce and
the unscrupulous greed of the other people who
take the lion's share of the profits?  Of course he
would; and so he wants to educate the producer;
and protect him by the State; and see that he isn't
swindled.  Go to; thou art Didymus, and an
unbeliever; I suspect Lord Musselburgh has been
corrupting you.  Tell me," she said, irrelevantly,
"who is the woman with the black curls—I did
not catch her name when she was introduced to me—"

He was delighted that she showed no sign of
returning to that awkward topic.

"Goodness gracious me, aunt," said he, glancing
in the direction indicated, where sat an elderly
lady, thin and gaunt and pale, with large lustrous
black eyes, and black hair clone up in the fashion
of a generation ago, "do you mean to say you don't
know Madame Mikucsek?"

"Who is Madame—What-is-it?"

"You never even heard of her!" he exclaimed,
in affected astonishment.  "Madame Mikucsek—the
discoverer of the Mystery of the East—the
Prophetess of the New Religion—who has her
followers and disciples all over the world—from
Syria to the Himalayas—from New York to
Sacramento.  Really, aunt, you surprise me: you
will be saying next you never heard of *Bô*."

"What is Bô—or who is he?" she demanded,
impatiently.

"*Bô*," he repeated, as if he were too puzzled by
her appalling ignorance to be able to explain, "why,
*Bô*—*Bô* is the equivalent of the Chinese *Tá*.  It is
the principle of life; it is the beginning and the
end of all things; it is the condition of the soul—and
yet not quite the condition of the soul, for the
soul can live outside *Bô* until the miracle of
initiation happens.  Then the soul is received into
*Bô*, and finds that the present is non-existent, and
that only the past and the future exist, the future
being really the past, when once the soul has
entered *Bô*—"

"Vin, I believe you are making a fool of me," the
pretty Mrs. Ellison said, severely.

"Oh, I assure you, aunt," he said, with eyes
innocent of guile, "it is the great discovery of the
age—the great discovery of all time—the Sacred—the
Ineffable.  When you enter into *Bô* you lose
your individuality—or rather, you never had any
individuality—for individuality was a confusion of
thought, a product of the present, and the present,
as I have explained to you, my dear aunt, ceases
to exist when you have entered *Bô*.  Did I tell you
that *Bô* is sentient?  Yes, but yet not a being;
though there are manifestations, mysterious and
ecstatic; and the disciples write to each other on
the first day of each month, and tell each other
what trances they have been in, and what
spiritual joy they have received.  These reports
are sent to Madame Mikucsek; and they are
published in a journal that circulates among the
initiated; but the phraseology is hieratic, the outside
world could make nothing of it.  As for her, she
is not expected to reveal anything—what she
experiences transcends human speech, and even
human thought—"

"I saw the woman mopping up gravy with a piece
of bread," said Mrs. Ellison, with frowning eyebrows.

"*Bô*," continued the young man, very seriously,
"as far as I have been able to make it out, consists
of a vast sphere; elliptical, however: the zenith
containing all human aspiration, the base consisting
of forgotten evil.  When you once enter this magic
circle, you are lost, you are transformed, you are
here and yet not here; to be does not signify to be
but not to be; and not to be is the highest good
except not to have been.  *Bô*, when once you have
received the consecration, and bathed in the light,
and perceived the altitudes and the essential deeps
and cognisances—"

"Ought to be written Bosh," said she, briefly.
"I will not hear any more of that nonsense.  And
I believe you are only humbugging me: Madame
What's-her-name looks more like the widow of a
French Communist.  Now listen to me, Vin, for I
am going away to-morrow.  I am glad I was
mistaken about the actress; but take care; don't
get into scrapes.  I shan't be happy till I see you
married.  Ordinarily a man should not marry until
he is thirty or five-and-thirty—if he is five-and-forty
so much the better—but even at five-and-thirty,
he may have acquired a little judgment; he may
be able to tell how much honesty there is in the
extreme amiability and unselfishness and simplicity
that a young woman can assume, or whether she is
likely to turn out an ill-conditioned, cross-grained,
and sulking brute.  Oh, you needn't laugh: it's no
laughing matter, as you'll find out, my young
friend.  But you—you are different; you are no
schoolboy; you've seen the world—too much of it,
for you've learnt disrespect for your elders, and try
to bamboozle them with accounts of sham systems
of philosophy or religion or whatever it is.  I say
you ought to marry young; but not an elderly
woman, as many a young man does, for money or
position.  Good gracious, no!  You'll have plenty
of money; your father isn't just yet going to sell
this silver dinner-service—which I detest, for it
always looks more greasy than china, and besides
you feel as if you were scoring it with the edge
of your knife all the time—I say he isn't going to
sell his silver and distribute unto the poor just yet.
As for position, you've got to make that for
yourself: would you owe it to your wife?  Very well,"
proceeded his pretty monitress, in her easy and
prattling fashion; "come down to Brighton for
a week or two.  I will ask the Drexel girls; you
will have them all to yourself, to pick and choose
from, but Louie is my favourite.  You have no idea
how delightful Brighton is in June—the inland
drives are perfect, so cool and shaded with trees,
when you know where to go, that is.  If you come
down I'll make up a party and take you all to Ascot:
Mrs. Bourke has offered me her house for the
week—isn't that good-natured, when she could easily
have let it?—and I have to telegraph yes or no
to-morrow.  I hadn't intended going myself; but if
you say you will come down, I will accept; and
I know I can get the Drexel girls."

"It is so kind of you, aunt; so very kind," he
said; "but I really can't get away.  You know I
don't care much about racing—

"But Louie Drexel isn't racing."

"I'm very sorry, but you must excuse me, aunt,"
he said contritely.

"Oh—distribution of wealth—supply and
demand—sugar-bounties and blue-books—is that it?
Well, well, what the young men of the present day
are coming to—"

She could say no more; for at this moment her
neighbour, an elderly and learned gentleman from
Oxford, addressed her.  He had not hitherto uttered
a word, having paid strict attention to every dish
and every wine (albeit he was a lean and
famished-looking person); but now he remarked that the
evenings were hot for the middle of June.  He
spoke of the danger of having recourse to iced
fluids.  Then he went on to compare the bathing
of the Greeks and Romans with the ablutions of
the English—until he was offered strawberries,
whereupon, having helped himself largely, he fell
into a business-like silence again.

When at length the ladies had gone upstairs,
Lord Musselburgh came and took the seat just
vacated by Mrs. Ellison.

"I have a commission from your father, Vin,"
said he.  "I am to persuade you of the sweet
reasonableness of his project—that you should for
a time become the private secretary of Mr. Ogden."

"The private secretary of a man who hasn't an
*h*!" retorted Master Vin, with scorn.

"What has that to do with it?" the young
nobleman said, coolly.  "No.  After all, there is
something in what your father says.  He believes that
the next great political and social movement will
be the emancipation of the wage-earner—the
securing to the producer his fair share of the products
of his labour.  If that is so, it will be a big thing.
It will be years before it comes off, no doubt; but
then there will be a great wave of public opinion;
and if you are prepared—if you are there—if you
are identified with this tremendous social revolution,
why, that magnificent wave will peacefully and
calmly lift you into the Cabinet.  I think that's
about his notion.  Very well.  If you are willing to
take up this work, how could you begin better than
by becoming private secretary to Josiah Ogden?
There you would come into direct touch with the
masses; you would get to know at first hand what
they are thinking of, what they are hoping
for; subsequently, you could speak with authority.
Then there's another thing, Vin.  If you want to
become a figure in public life in England, if you
want to build a splendid monument for yourself,
you should begin at the base.  Capture the
multitude; be as red-hot a Radical as they can desire;
and they won't mind what you do afterwards.  You
may accept office; you may be petted by Royalty;
but they will rather like it—they will look on it
as a compliment paid to one of themselves.  And
that is where Ogden would come in.  He, too, is one
of themselves—though he has his hired brougham
when he comes to town, and his big dinners at
the Menagerie Club.  What have you got to do
with his *h*'s?  If I want to back a horse, or order
a pair of boots, or have my hair cut, what does it
matter to me whether the man has an *h*, or a
superfluity of *h*'s?  You make him useful to you; you
get what you want; isn't that enough?"

"Oh, no, it is not," Vincent rejoined—but
respectfully, for he never forgot that Lord
Musselburgh was his senior by very nearly five years.
"You see, you don't go into partnership with your
hairdresser, and you don't put your name over the
bootmaker's shop.  And I shouldn't learn much
from Mr. Ogden, for I don't believe in his machine-made
politics—everything to be done by committees,
and resolutions, and majorities.  I expect to find him
starting a Society for the Suppression of Punch and
Judy Shows, so that the infantile mind of England
may not be corrupted by exhibitions of brutality."

"He is a very able man, let me tell you that,"
said Musselburgh, with decision.  "And a capital
speaker—a slogger, of course, but that is wanted
for big crowds.  And sometimes he turns out a neat
thing.  Did you notice what he said at Sheffield the
other day—telling the working men not to be too
grateful for rich men's charities—for recreation
grounds, drinking fountains, and the like?  What
he said was this—'When the capitalist has robbed
Peter, it is easy for him to salve his conscience by
throwing a crust to Paul'—not bad.  I think you
might do worse, Vin, than become Ogden's private
secretary.  Pretty hard work, of course; but the
modern young man, in politics, is supposed to be
thoroughly in earnest: if he isn't he will have to
reckon with the evening papers, for they don't like
to be trifled with."

The subject was not a grateful one, apparently;
Vincent changed it.

"Do you remember," he said, with some little
diffidence, "that—that I was in your house one
afternoon a few weeks ago when an old gentleman
called—and—and his granddaughter—"

"The perfervid old Scotchman—yes!"

"How did you come to know him?" the young
man asked, with downcast eyes.

"I hardly recollect.  Let me see.  I think he
first of all wrote to me, enclosing a note of
introduction he had brought from a friend of mine in
New York—a brother Scot.  Then, as you saw, he
called, and told me something further about a book
he is going to bring out; and I gave him some
little assistance—I don't think he is above
accepting a few sovereigns from any one to help him on
his way through the world."

Vin Harris flushed hotly—and he raised his head
and looked his friend straight in the face as he put
the next question.

"But—but he is a gentleman!—his name—his
family—even his bearing—"

"Oh, yes, yes, I suppose so," Lord Musselburgh
said, lightly.  "Poor old fellow, I was glad to lend
him a helping hand.  I think his enthusiasm, his
patriotism, was genuine; and it is a thing you don't
often meet with nowadays."

"Yes—but—but—-" Vincent said, with a good
deal of embarrassment, and yet with some touch of
half-indignant remonstrance, "the money you gave
him—that was to aid him in bringing out the book,
wasn't it?"

"Certainly, certainly!" the other made answer—he
did not happen to notice the expression on
his friend's face.  "Something about Scotland—Scotch
poetry—I think when he wrote he said
something about a dedication, but that is an honour
I hardly covet."

"In any case," observed the young man, "you
have no right to say he would accept money
from—from anyone—from a stranger."

Then Lord Musselburgh did look up—struck by
something in his companion's tone.

"Did I say that?  I'm sure I don't know.  Of
course it was on account of the book that I ventured
to give him some little help—oh, yes, certainly—I
should not have ventured otherwise.  If he had
been offended, I dare say he would have said so;
but I fancy the old gentleman has had to overcome
his pride before now.  He seems to have led a
curious, wandering life.  By the way, Vin, weren't
you very much impressed by the young lady—I
remember your saying something—"

Fortunately there was no need for Vincent to
answer this question; for now there began a general
movement on the part of the remaining guests to
go upstairs to the drawing-room; and in this little
bit of a bustle he escaped from further cross-examination.

When at the end of the evening all the people
had gone away, and when Harland Harris had shut
himself up in his study to finish his correspondence—for
he was going down the next morning to a
Congress of Co-operative Societies at
Ipswich—Mrs. Ellison and her nephew found themselves alone in
the drawing-room; and the fair young widow must
needs return to the subject she had been discoursing
upon at dinner—namely, that this young man, in
order to guard against pitfalls and embroilments,
should get married forthwith.

"You seem anxious that I should marry," said he,
bluntly; "why don't you get married yourself?"

"Oh, no, thank you!" she replied, with
promptitude.  "I know when I have had—"  Apparently
she was on the point of saying that she knew when
she had had enough; but that would not have
been complimentary to the memory of the deceased;
so she abruptly broke off—and then resumed.  "It
isn't necessary for me to make any further
experiments in life; but for you, with such a splendid
future before you, it is a necessity.  As for me, I
mean to let well alone.  And it is well—very well.
I do believe, Vin, that I am the only woman on this
earth—"

"What?" he said.

"—who is really contented.  I am too happy.
Sometimes I'm afraid; it seems as if I had no right
to it.  Why, when I come downstairs in the
morning, and draw an easy-chair to the open
windows—especially when there is a breeze coming off the sea,
and the sun-blinds are out, and the balcony nicely
shaded, you know—I mean at home, in Brunswick
Terrace—well, when I take up the newspaper and
begin to read about what's going on—as if it was
all some kind of a distant thing—I feel so satisfied
with the quiet and the coolness and the sea-air that
I am bound to do a little kindness to somebody, and
so I turn to the columns where appeals are made
for charity.  I don't care what it is; I'm so well
content that I must give something to somebody—distressed
Irish widows, sailors' libraries, days in the
country, anything.  I dare say I sometimes give
money where I shouldn't; but how am I to know?—and
at any rate it pleases me."

"But why shouldn't you be happy, aunt?" said
the young man.  "You are so good-humoured,
and so kind, and so nice to look at, that it is
no wonder you are such a favourite, with men
especially."

"Oh, yes," she said, frankly.  "Men are always
nice to you—except the one you happen to marry;
and I'm not going to spoil the situation.  At present
they're all sweetness, and that suits me: I'm not
going to give any one of them the chance of
showing himself an ungrateful brute.  When I come
downstairs at Brighton, I like to see only one cup
on the breakfast-table, and to feel that I have the
whole room to myself.  Selfish?—then you can
make amends by sending something to the Children's
Hospital or the People's Palace or something
of that kind."

"Do you know, aunt," he observed, gravely,
"what Mr. Ogden says of you?  He says that,
having robbed Peter, you try to salve your conscience
by throwing a crust to Paul."

"When did I rob Peter?—what Peter?" she
said, indignantly.

"You are a capitalist—you have more than your
own share—you possess what you do not work
for—therefore you are a robber and a plunderer.  I am
sorry for you, aunt; but Mr. Ogden has pronounced
your doom—

"Mr. Ogden——!" she said, with angry brows—and
then she stopped.

"Yes, aunt?" he said, encouragingly.

"Oh, nothing.  But I tell you this, Vin.  You
were talking of the proper distribution of wealth.
Well, when you come to marry, and if I approve of
the girl, I mean to distribute a little of my
plunder—of my ill-gotten gains—in that direction: she
shan't come empty-handed.  That is, if I approve of
her, you understand.  And the best thing you can
do is to alter your mind and come down to Brighton
for a week or two; and I'll send for the Drexel girls
and perhaps one or two more.  If you can't just at
present, you may later on.  Now I'm going off to
my room; and I'll say good-bye as well as
good-night; for I don't suppose I shall see you in the
morning.

"Good-night, then, and good-bye, aunt!" said
he, as he held her hand for a second; and that
was the last that he saw of her for some considerable time.

For a great change was about to take place in
this young man's position and circumstances, in his
interests, and ambitions, and trembling hopes.  He
was about to enter wonderland—that so many have
entered, stealthily and almost fearing—that so many
remember, and perhaps would fain forget.  Do any
remain in that mystic and rose-hued region?  Some,
at least, have never even approached it; for its
portals are not easily discoverable, are not discoverable
at all, indeed, except by the twin torches of
imagination and abolition of self.

When he went up to his chambers the next
morning he was surprised to find a card lying on
the table; he had not expected a visitor in this
secluded retreat.  And when he glanced at the
name, he was still more perturbed.  What an
opportunity he had missed!  Perhaps Mr. Bethune
had brought an informal little invitation for
him—the first overture of friendliness?  He might have
spent the evening in the hushed, small parlour over
the way, with those violin strains vibrating through
the dusk; or, with the lights ablaze, he might have
sate and listened to the old man's tales of travel,
while Maisrie Bethune would be sitting at her
needle-work, but looking up from time to time—each
glance a world's wonder!  And what had he
had in exchange?—a vapid dinner-party; some talk
about socialism; an invitation that he should
descend into the catacombs of North of England
politics and labour mole-like there to no apparent
end; finally, a promise that if he would only marry
the young lady of Mrs. Ellison's choice—presumably
one of her American friends—his bride should have
some additional dowry to recommend her.  What
were all those distant schemes, and even the brilliant
future that everybody seemed to prophesy for him,
to the bewildering possibilities that were almost
within his reach?  He went to the window.  The
pots of musk, and lobelia, and ox-eye daisies, in the
little balcony over there, and also the Virginia
creeper intertwisting its sprays through the iron
bars, seemed fresh: no doubt she had sprinkled
them with water before leaving with her grandfather.
And had they gone to Hyde Park as usual?  He
was sorely tempted to go in search; but something
told him this might provoke suspicions; so he
resolutely hauled in a chair to the table and set to
work with his books and annotations—though
sometimes there came before his eyes a nebulous vision,
as of a sheet of silver-grey water and a shimmering
of elms.

In the afternoon he went out and bought a
clothes-brush, a couple of hair-brushes, some scented
soap, and other toilet requisites—of which he had
not hitherto known the need in these chambers;
and about five o'clock or a little thereafter, having
carefully removed the last speck from his coat-sleeve,
he crossed the way, and rather timidly knocked at
the door.  It was opened by the landlady's daughter,
who appeared at once surprised and pleased on
finding who this visitor was.

"Is Mr. Bethune at home?" he demanded—with
some vaguely uncomfortable feeling that this
damsel's eyes looked too friendly.  She seemed
to understand everything—to have been expecting him.

"Oh, yes, sir."

"May I go upstairs?"

He gave no name; but she did not hesitate for
a moment.  She led the way upstairs; she tapped
lightly; and in answer to Mr. Bethune's loud
"Come in!" she opened the door, and said—

"The young gentleman, sir,"—a form of announcement
that might have struck Vincent as peculiar if
he had not been much too occupied to notice.

"Ah, how do you do—how do you do?" old
George Bethune (who was alone) called out, and
he pushed aside his book and came forward with
extended hand.  "Nothing like being neighbourly;
solitary units in the great sea of London life have
naturally some interest in each other: you would
gather that I looked in on you last night—"

"Yes," said the young man, as he took the
proffered chair.  "I am very sorry I happened to
be out—I had to dine at home last evening—"

"At home?" repeated Mr. Bethune, looking for
the moment just a trifle puzzled.

"Oh, yes," said his visitor, rather nervously.
"Perhaps I didn't explain.  I don't *live* over there,
you know.  I only have the rooms for purposes of
study; the place is so quiet I can get on better than
at home; there are no interruptions—"

"Except a little violin-playing?" the old man
suggested, good-naturedly.

"I wish there were more of that, sir," Vincent
observed, respectfully.  "That was only in the
evenings; and I used to wait for it, to tell you the
truth, as a kind of unintentional reward after my
day's work.  But of late I have heard nothing; I
hope that Miss Bethune was not offended that
I ventured to—to open my piano at the same time—"

"Oh, not at all—I can hardly think so," her
grandfather said, airily.  "She also has been busy
with her books of late—it is Dante, I believe, at
present—and as I insist on her always reading aloud,
whatever the language is, she goes upstairs to her
own room; so that I haven't seen much of her in the
evenings.  Now may I offer you a cigar?"

"No, thank you."

"Or a glass of claret?"

"No, thanks."

"Then tell me what your studies are, that we
may become better acquainted."

And Vincent was about to do that when the door
behind him opened.  Instinctively he rose and
turned.  The next instant Maisrie Bethune was
before him—looking taller, he thought, than he had,
in Hyde Park, imagined her to be.  She saluted him
gravely and without embarrassment; perhaps she
had been told of his arrival; it was he who was, for
the moment, somewhat confused, and anxious to
apologise and explain.  But, curiously enough, that
was only a passing phase.  When once he had
realised that she also was in the room—not paying
much attention, perhaps, but listening when she
chose, as she attended to some flowers she had
brought for the central table—all his embarrassment
fled, and his natural buoyancy and confidence came
to his aid.  She, on her side, seemed to consider
that she was of no account; that she was not called
upon to interfere in this conversation between her
grandfather and his guest.  When she had finished
with the flowers, she went to the open window, and
took her seat, opening out some needlework she
had carried thither.  The young man could see she
had beautiful hands—rather long, perhaps, but
exquisitely formed: another wonder!  But the truly
extraordinary thing—the enchantment—was that
here he was in the same room with her, likely to
become her friend, and already privileged to speak
so that she could hear!

For of course he was aware that he had an
audience of two; and very well he talked, in his
half-excited mood.  There was no more timidity;
there was a gay self-assertion—a desire to excel and
shine; sometimes he laughed, and his laugh was
musical.  He had skillfully drawn from the old man
a confession of political faith (of course he was a
Conservative, as became one of the Bethunes of
Balloray), so all chance of collision was avoided on
that point; and indeed Vin Harris was ready to
have sworn that black was white, so eager was he to
make an impression, on this his first, and wondrous
visit.

The time went by all too quickly; but the young
man had become intoxicated by this unexpected joy;
instead of getting up and apologising, and taking his
hat, and going away, he boldly threw out the
suggestion that these three—these solitary units in
the great sea of London life, as George Bethune had
called them—should determine to spend the evening
together.  He did not seem to be aware of the
audacity of his proposal; he was carrying everything
before him in a high-handed fashion; the touch of
colour that rose to Maisrie Bethune's cheek—what
of that?  Oh, yes, maiden shyness, no doubt; but
of little consequence; here were the golden
moments—here the golden opportunity: why should
they separate?

"You see," said he, "I don't care to inconvenience
our people at home by my uncertain hours; and so
of late I have taken to dining at a restaurant, just
when I felt inclined; and I have got to know
something of the different places.  I think we might go
out for a little stroll, as the evening will be cooler
now, and wander on until we see a quiet and
snug-looking corner.  There is something in freedom of
choice; and you may catch sight of a bay window,
or of a recess with flowers in it, and a bit of a
fountain that tempts the eye—"

"What do you say, Maisrie?" the old gentleman
inquired.

"You go, grandfather," the girl replied at once,
but without raising her head.  "It will be a
pleasant change for you.  I would rather remain
at home."

"Oh, but I should never have proposed such a
thing," Vincent interposed, hastily, "if it meant
that Miss Bethune was to be left here alone,
certainly not!  I—I decline to be a party to any
such arrangement—oh, I could not think of such a
thing!"

"You'd better come, Maisrie," said the old man,
with some air of authority.

"Very well, grandfather," she said, obediently;
and straightway she rose and left the room.

Master Vin's heart beat high; here were wonders
upon wonders; in a short space he would be walking
along the pavements of London town with Maisrie
Bethune by his side (or practically so) and thereafter
he and she would be seated at the same table,
almost within touch of each other.  Would the wide
world get to hear of this marvellous thing?  Would
the men and women whom they encountered in
Oxford-street observe and conjecture, and perhaps
pass on with some faint vision of that beautiful and
pensive face imprinted on their memory?  By what
magic freak of fortune had he came to be so favoured?
Those people in Oxford-street were all strangers to
her, and would remain strangers; he alone would be
admitted to the sacred privacies of her companionship
and society; but a few minutes more, and he
would be instructing himself in her little ways and
preferences, each one a happy secret to be kept
wholly to himself.  But the entranced young man
was hardly prepared for what now followed.  When
the door opened again, and Maisrie Bethune
reappeared (her eyes were averted from him, and there
was a self-conscious tinge of colour in her pale and
thoughtful face) she seemed to have undergone some
sudden transformation.  The youthful look lent to
her appearance by the long and loose-flowing locks
and by her plain dress of blue and white linen had
gone; and here was a young lady apparently about
twenty, tall, self-possessed (notwithstanding that
tinge of colour) and grave in manner.  A miracle
had been wrought!—and yet she had only plaited
up her hair, tying it with a bit of blue ribbon, and
donned a simple costume of cream-coloured cashmere.
She was putting on her gloves now; and he thought
that long hands were by far the most beautiful of any.

Well, it was all a bewilderment—this walking along
the London streets under the pale saffron of the
evening sky, listening to the old man's emphatic
monologue, but far more intent on warning Miss
Bethune of the approach of a cab, when she was
about to cross this or the other thoroughfare.
Once he touched her arm in his anxiety to check
her; he had not intended to do so; and it was
he who was thunderstruck and ashamed; she did
not appear to have noticed.  And then again he
was afraid lest she should be tired before they
reached the particular restaurant he had in mind;
to which old George Bethune replied that his
granddaughter did not know what fatigue was; he
and she could walk for a whole day, strolling
through the parks or along the streets, with absolute
ease and comfort, as became vagrants and world-wanderers.

"Though I am not so sure it is altogether good
for Maisrie here," he continued.  "It may be that
that has kept her thin—she is too thin for a young
lass.  She is all spirit; she has no more body than
a daddy long-legs."

Vincent instantly offered to call a cab—which
they refused; but he was not beset by wild alarms;
he knew that, however slight she might be, the
natural grace and elegance of her carriage could
only be the outcome of a symmetrical form in
conjunction with elastic health.  That conclusion
he had arrived at in the Park; but now he noticed
another thing—that, as she walked, the slightly-swaying
arms had the elbow well in to the waist,
and the wrist turned out, and that quite obviously
without set purpose.  It was a pretty movement;
but it was more than merely graceful; it was one
mark of a well-balanced figure, even as was her
confident step.  For her step could be confident
enough, and the set of her head proud enough—if
she mostly kept her eyes to the ground.

It was an Italian restaurant they entered at last;
and Vincent was so fortunate as to find a
recess-compartment, which he knew of, vacant.  They
were practically dining in a private room; but all
the same they could when they chose glance out
upon the large saloon, with its little white tables,
and its various groups of olive-complexioned or
English-complexioned guests.  The young man
assumed the management of this small festivity
from the outset.  He ordered a flask of Chianti for
Mr. Bethune and himself; and then he would have
got something lighter—some sparkling beverage—for
the young lady, but that she told him that she
drank no wine.  Why, he said to himself, he might
have known!—

   |      'for in her veins
   |  Ran blood as pure and cool as summer rains.'

And as this modest little repast went on, perhaps
Vincent was comparing it with the banquet of the
night before.  Ah, there had been no enhancement,
no enthralling ecstacy and delight, about that
entertainment, sumptuous as it was.  Here was
some food—he hardly looked at it—he did not
know what it was, and did not care—which would
have to be paid for at the rate of 3/6 per head;
but as compared with this frugal festivity, the
splendours of the preceding evening—the masses of
roses, the pyramids of ice, the silver candelabra,
and all the rest—shrank into insignificance.  'Here
there was a nameless glamour filling all the air;
a palpitation of hope, and a curious dumb sense of
gratitude as if for favours unexpected and
undeserved; all the coming years of his life seemed
to be shining there in her eyes—so that he hardly
dared to look, so full of fear, and yet of a breathless
joy and wonder, was the revelation, when she
happened to glance towards him.  And on her side,
she appeared to be a little less reserved and distant
than she had hitherto been.  She seemed grateful
for the trouble the young man had taken on behalf
of her grandfather and herself; sometimes, when
in his eager talk he said something that interested
her, she raised her head, with a smile in her eyes.
A wonderful banquet, truly, though not so imposing
as that of the previous night.  He learned that she
was immensely fond of propelling a gondola (the
forward oar only; she wanted another oar astern
to steer) and here was another amazingly interesting
fact, to be for ever and ever remembered.

As for the old man (for the world was not created
solely for young folk) he was at once gay and
oracular.

"These little breaks and diversions," he was
saying, as he stirred his coffee—the time of
cigarettes having now arrived, "are useful things—useful
things; an affair of the moment, truly; but
the wise man makes of the passing moment as
much as he possibly can.  Why, the real curse of
modern life—the ineradicable disease—is the habit
of continually looking before and after.  We none
of us think enough of the present moment; we are
anxiously speculating as to the future; or, what is
worse still, fretting over the memory of past injuries
and past mistakes.  That is where the uneducated,
the unimaginative, have their consolation; we
are not half so happy and content as the stolid
ploughman or the phlegmatic bricklayer who thinks
only of the present heat, or the present cold, or,
at furthest, of the next pint of beer, and of the
prospect of getting to bed, with the knowledge that
he will sleep sound.  The actual and immediate
things before them are the things that interest
them; not the unknown future, or the useless past.
But I have schooled myself, thanks in a great
measure to Horace—and my granddaughter knows
her Horace too—and I think I keep as stout a heart
as most.  *Dum loquimur*, of course, *fugerit invida
ætas*; but even while I know that the night presses
down upon me, and the shadowy fathers, and the
empty halls of Pluto, I put the knowledge away
from me; I am content with the present moment;
I am more than content, for example, with this very
excellent cigarette—"

"Would you allow me to send you a few boxes?"
interposed Vincent, at once and eagerly.  "I think
the cork mouthpiece is a great improvement.  I
know where they are to be got.  May I send you
some?"

"I thank you; but they are not much in my
way," the old man said, with a certain loftiness
of demeanour.  "As I was remarking, the time has
gone by for unavailing regrets over what has been
done to me and mine.  I think I may say that
throughout we have shown a bold front.  '*Stand
fast, Craig-Royston!*' has not been our watchword for
nothing.  And as for the future—why, 'to the
gods belongs to-morrow!'  The anticipation of evil
will not remove it: the recalling of bygone injuries
provides no compensation.  'The present moment
is our ain; the neist we never saw;' and so, as we
have had a pleasant evening so far, I think we may
as well get away home again; and, Maisrie, you
will get out your violin, and we'll have some Scotch
songs, and my young friend and I will taste just a
drop of Scotch whisky; and if there's any better
combination than that in the world, I do not know
of it."

But here a very awkward incident occurred.  Old
George Bethune, in his grand manner, called to the
waiter to bring the bill.  Now Vincent had
intended to steal out and arrange this little matter
without allowing the young lady to have any
cognisance of it; but of course the waiter, when
summoned, came up to the table, and proceeded to
pencil out the account.

"I think, sir," put in the young man, modestly,
"you'd better let me have that.  It was my proposal,
you know."

"Oh, very well," said Mr. Bethune, carelessly;
and as carelessly he handed over the slip of paper
he had just taken from the waiter.

But the quick look of pain and humiliation that
swept over the girl's face stabbed the young man to
the heart.

"Grandfather!" she said, with a burning flush.

"Oh, well," her grandfather said, petulantly;
"I have just discovered that I have left my purse
behind.  Some other time—it is all the same—it
is immaterial—the next time will be my
turn—"

"Here is my purse, grandfather," she said; and
she turned with an air of quiet firmness to her
younger neighbour, and merely said "If you
please!"  He was too bewildered to refuse: there
was something in her manner that compelled him
to accede without a word of protest.  She pushed
her purse and the slip of paper across the table to
her grandfather; and then she rose, and turned to
seek her sun-shade, which Vincent forthwith
brought to her.  The curious mingling of simplicity
and dignity with which she had interposed
impressed him strangely: perhaps she was not so
much of a school-girl as she had seemed when he
first saw her walking through Hyde Park?  Then
the three of them left the restaurant together; and
quietly made their way home through the gathering
twilight.

But he would not go in when they arrived at
their door, though the old man again put Scotch
music and Scotch whisky before him as an inducement.
Perhaps he dreaded to outstay his welcome.
He bade them both good-night; and Maisrie Bethune,
as she parted from him, was so kind as to say
"Thank you so much!" with the briefest, timid
glance of her all-too-eloquent eyes.

He went across to his own rooms—merely for
form's sake.  He did not light the gas when he
got upstairs.  He carefully shut the window; then
he sate down to the piano; and very gently and
quietly he played a graceful little air.  It was
"*Dormez, dormez, ma belle!*"; and it was a kind of
farewell message for the night; but he had made
sure that she should not hear.

When Maisrie Bethune and her grandfather
returned home after the little dinner at the restaurant
she went upstairs to her own room, while he
proceeded to summon the landlady's husband from
the lower deeps.  Forthwith the pallid-faced and
nervous-eyed Hobson appeared; and he seemed to
be more obsequious than ever towards the great
man who had deigned to patronise his humble
literary efforts, and had even got some of his verses
printed in the Edinburgh *Weekly Chronicle*.

"Very hot evening, sir—yes, sir—would you like
me to go and fetch you a little hice, sir?" said he,
in his eager desire to please.  "No trouble, sir, if
agreeable to you—remarkably 'ot for June,
sir—theatres doing nothing, sir—only the ballet: you
see, sir, the young ladies have so little on that they
look cool and airy-like, and I suppose, sir, that's
why the ballet is so popular—yes, sir, my brother-in-law,
the theatrical agent—"

"Look here, Hobson," Mr. Bethune observed, as
if he had not heard a word, "you have no doubt
noticed a young gentleman who occupies rooms over
the way?"

"Oh, yes, sir—a very handsome young man," he
answered—or rather, what he actually did say was
"a werry ensome young men."

"I have just made his acquaintance."  Mr. Bethune
continued, in his lofty fashion, "and naturally I
should like to know something more of him, though
I could not be guilty of the rudeness of asking him
questions about himself.  For example, I should be
glad to know where he lives—he only uses those
rooms during the day, you understand; and I
presume that would be a simple thing for you to
ascertain—discreetly, I mean, discreetly—without any
impertinent intrusion."

"Oh, yes, sir," said Hobson, his dull face lighting
up with pleasure at the notion of being able to do
his patron a service.  "Yes, yes, sir; I can find
out; what more simple?"

At this very moment there was the sound of a
door being shut on the opposite side of the street.
Hobson stepped to the open window; and instantly
withdrew his head again.

"He has just gone out, sir—I will follow him."

"But discreetly, Hobson, discreetly," was the old
gentleman's final injunction, as his humble and
zealous emissary departed.

When Maisrie Bethune came downstairs again,
she was in her ordinary dress of striped linen; and
she seemed pleased with the evening's adventure;
and was more talkative than usual.

"It will be very pleasant for you, grandfather,"
said she, "to have so intelligent and interesting
a neighbour—don't you think so?  For though he
is young, he seems to know everything, and to have
been everywhere; and I am sure, you and he,
grandfather, found plenty of things to talk about.
I have just been wondering whether it is possible he
could have come to Toronto while we were living
there.  Wouldn't that have been strange?  Perhaps
we have passed him while we were walking along
King-street; perhaps he may have come round the
corner by the Bank of Montreal when we were going
into Yonge-street—and not a yard between us!
But no," she continued, musingly, "I hardly
imagine it could have been.  I think I should have
noticed him, and remembered.  Don't you think
you would have noticed him, grandfather?  He is
not like any one else—I mean he is not the kind of
person you would pass in the street without
remarking—I don't think you would forget.  Oh, yes, I am
very glad for your sake, grandfather, that you have
made his acquaintance; and I hope you will
become good friends—although he is young.  You
want some one to talk to—and not that dreadful
Hobson—I can't bear your talking to Hobson,
grandfather—"

"I am no respecter of persons, Maisrie," said the
old man, pompously, "so long as people know their
place, and keep it."

"But that is just the worst of Hobson, grandfather!"
she exclaimed.  "His fawning and cringing
is so despicable.  He is not a man at all.  And
you should tell him the truth about those verses
of his, grandfather: I can't imagine how you see
anything in them—"

"There have been worse—there have been worse,"
said Mr. Bethune, with a magnanimous toleration.
"And on the two occasions on which I got the
*Chronicle* to let him see himself in print, the
gratitude of the poor creature was quite pathetic.  A
little act of kindness is never thrown away, Maisrie,
my dear.  So now you'll just get out your violin,
and for a little while we will cross the Border, and
forget that we are here in the heart of this stifling
London."

But Maisrie begged to be excused.  She said she
was rather tired, and was going back to her own
room very soon.  And indeed, when she had brought
her grandfather his accustomed hot water, and
sugar, and spirits, and generally made everything
comfortable for him, she kissed him and bade him
good night and went away upstairs.

It was not to go to bed, however.  Having lit
the gas, she proceeded to hunt among her books
until she discovered a little album entitled "Views
of Toronto;" and having spread that open on
her dressing-table, she drew in a chair, and, with
her elbows resting on the table, and her head
between her hands, began to pore over those
pictures of the long thoroughfares and the pavements
and the public buildings.  She seemed to find the
rather ill-executed lithographs interesting—so
interesting that we may leave her there with her eyes
fixed intently on the brown pages.

Meanwhile Hobson had fulfilled his mission, and
returned with the address of the house into which
he had seen the young man disappear; and not
only that, but he volunteered to gain any further
information that Mr. Bethune might wish; it would
be easy for him, he said, to make the acquaintance
of one of the menservants in Grosvenor Place.

"Not at all—not at all!" the old man made
response, with an affectation of indifference.  "I have
no wish to pry.  Indeed, I cannot say that I have
any particular curiosity in the matter.  And you
need not mention to any one that I know even as
much as that.  I cannot recall now what made me
ask—a momentary impulse—nothing of any
consequence—for in truth it matters little to me where
the young man lives.  Well, good-night, Hobson—and
thank you."

"Good-night, sir," said Hobson, with his eyes
dwelling lingeringly on the hot water and whisky.
But he received no invitation (for old George
Bethune was more amenable to his granddaughter's
remonstrances than he himself was aware) and so,
with another effusive "*Good*-night!" the landlady's
husband humbly withdrew.

Sometimes, after Maisrie had gone to bed, or, at
least, retired to her own room, her grandfather
would wander away out in the streets by himself.
The night air was cool; there were fewer passers-by
to impede his aimless peregrinations; sheltered by
the dark and the dull lamp-light, he could lift up
his voice and sing "London's bonnie woods and
braes," or "Cam' ye by Athol," or "There's nae
Covenant now, lassie," when he happened to be in
the mood, as he generally was.  And on this
particular evening he sallied forth; but the straight-forward
direction of his steps showed that he had an
objective point.  He went along Oxford-street, and
down Regent-street; and eventually, by way of
Garrick-street, Covent Garden, and the Strand,
reached Fleet-street, where he stopped at a
building almost wholly consisting of offices of country
newspapers.  At this time of the night the place
was at its busiest—a hive of industry: messengers
coming and going, the operators assiduous at the
special wires, the London correspondents constructing
their letters out of the latest news, with a
little imagination thrown in here and there to lend
colour.  Old George Bethune ascended to the first
floor, passed into the premises owned by the
Edinburgh *Chronicle* (*Daily* and *Weekly*) and was
admitted to an inner room, where he found
Mr. Courtnay Fox.  Now Mr. Fox—a heavy and
somewhat ungainly person, who rolled from side to side
as he crossed the room, and whose small blue eyes
twinkled behind his spectacles with a sort of easy
and ready sarcasm—did not like being interrupted;
but, on the other hand, Mr. Bethune was a friend,
or at least a favoured acquaintance, of the chief
proprietor of the *Chronicle*, and the London
correspondent was therefore bound to be civil; so he
asked the old man what he could do for him.

"If you have anything for the *Weekly*," he
observed, "you'd much better send it on direct to
Edinburgh, instead of sending it down here.  That
will save one postage—a point which I should have
thought would occur to a Scotch mind," he added,
with a bit of a half-concealed grin.

"You are always girding at Scotland, Mr. Fox,"
George Bethune said, good-naturedly.

"I?  Oh, not I.  I'm sure no one admires the
virtues of economy and frugality more than I do.
That is why I am pretty certain Shakespeare must
have lived in Scotland—I don't mean 'The rain it
raineth every day'—but 'a tanner will last you
nine year.'  Now how could he have learned that
money could be made to go so far but by
observation of the Scotch?"

"I know this," said the old man, with some
dignity, "that few have seen so much of the world
as I have, in various countries and climes; and the
most generous and hospitable people—generous and
hospitable to the point of extravagance—I have
ever met with have invariably been the Scotch.  It
may suit you to revile the country from which you
get your living—"

"Oh, I meant nothing so serious, I assure you,"
the ponderous journalist said at once.  "Come, tell
me what I can do for you."

"I should like to look at the Post Office
Directory first, if I may."

Courtnay Fox waddled across the room and
returned with the heavy volume: Mr. Bethune turned
to the street and number that had been furnished
him by his spy, and discovered that the name
given was Harland Harris—no doubt Vincent
Harris's father.

"Ah, yes," the old man said.  "Now I can tell
you what I want; and I am certain I have come
to the right place for information.  For while you
revile my countrymen, Mr. Fox, because you don't
know them, I wonder whom amongst your own
countrymen—who have any position at all—you
don't know?"

This was an adroit piece of flattery: for it was a
foible of the fat correspondent to affect that he
knew everybody—and knew no good of anybody.

"Of course the man I mean may be a nobody—or
a nonentity—and a very respectable person as
well," continued Mr. Bethune, "but his son, whose
acquaintance I have made, talks as if his name were
familiar to the public.  Mr. Harland Harris—"

"Harland Harris!" the journalist exclaimed—but
with much complacency, for he might have
been found wanting.  "Don't you know Harland
Harris?—or, at least, haven't you heard of him?"

"I have lived much out of England," the old man
said.

"And you want me to tell you who and what
Harland Harris is?  Is that it?  Well, then, I
will.  To begin with," proceeded Mr. Courtnay Fox,
with a baleful light in his small twinkling eyes,
"he is a solemn and portentous ass—a pedantic
prig—a combination of a drill sergeant and a
schoolmaster, with the self-sufficiency of—of—I
don't know what.  He is an enormously wealthy
man—who preaches the Divine Beauty of Poverty;
a socialist—who would abolish the income-tax, and
have all taxation indirect; a Communist—who can
eat only off gold plate.  This sham Jean Jacques
would not only abandon his children, he would let
the whole human race go to the mischief, as long
as you left him on a pinnacle, with a M.S. lecture
in his hand.  Harland Harris!  Do you want to
know any more?  Well, I will tell you this, that
long ago his vanity would have inflated and burst
him only that he was defeated in his candidature
for the Lord Rectorship of Edinburgh University—and
that let out a little of the gas.  But even now
his inconsistencies are colossal—almost a madness;
I think he must be drunk with a sense of his own
superiority, as George Sand says—"

"He does not seem to have made a very favourable
impression on you," said Mr. Bethune slowly
and thoughtfully.

"Did he ever on any human being?" the other
retorted.  "Not any one that ever I heard of!"

"And his son—do you know anything of him?"

Mr. Courtnay Fox was not likely to admit that
he knew nothing.

"Oh," said he, scornfully, "the *enfant gâté* of the
political world.  —— has made a pet of him; and
so people imagine there is something in him.  Of
course he'll talk for a few years about universal
brotherhood and the advancement of humanity and
that kind of stuff; and then, when he succeeds to
his father's money, he'll make a bid for a peerage,
or else marry a widowed and withered Countess,
and subside into a solid, substantial, beef-headed
bulwark of the Tory party.  That's the way they
all go!"

"Well, I'm very much obliged," said old George
Bethune, rising.  "And sorry to have interrupted
you.  Good-night—and thanks."

"Good-night," said the journalist, curtly, as he
turned to his desk again, and its litter of reports
and telegrams.

Next morning, when they were about to set forth
on their accustomed stroll, Maisrie paused at the
door for a second, and said—with a very curious
hesitation, and a face grown rose-red—

"Grandfather, what shall I tell Mrs. Hobson you
would like for dinner?"

He did not notice her confusion; he answered,
carelessly—

"Oh, never mind just now.  Later on we will
see.  Food is not of much importance in this hot
weather."

Thereafter she was silent for some considerable
time.  It was not until they had got down to the
Serpentine, and when he was about to take out his
newspaper, that she ventured again to address him.

"Grandfather," she said, timidly, "do you
think—Mr. Harris—expects us—expects that we should
dine together again this evening?  He did ask if
we had no engagement—and—and perhaps he may
imagine there is some understanding—"

"Well, Maisrie," the old man made answer, with
a playful irony, "if your way of it is to be carried
out, the arrangement wouldn't last very long.  I
don't suppose our little income could comfortably
support three for any great space of time."

"Oh, but, grandfather," she said, persuasively,
"you know it was but right you should pay; we
were two, and he only one; of course, if we were to
dine together again—and he wished it to be his
turn—you might divide—"

"I think, Maisrie," said he, somewhat sententiously,
"it would be better for you to leave our
small financial affairs in my hands.  These things
are well understood as between men; it is easy to
make an arrangement.  Especially easy if you are
the only son of a very wealthy man—what are a
few shillings or a few sovereigns one way or the
other to him?  And I wish you to remember that
a young lady's purse is not usually produced at a
restaurant."

"I am sorry if I did anything wrong, grandfather,"
she said humbly; "but—but I thought—before a
stranger—or almost a stranger—it was a pity you
had forgotten—"

He had opened the newspaper, so that the subject
was dismissed; and Maisrie was left to her absent
dreams and reveries.

All that day there came no message from the
other side of the street; and likewise the afternoon
wore away in silence; while Maisrie, whatever she
hoped or feared, had not again asked her
grandfather what arrangements he proposed for the
evening.  About six o'clock, however, there came a rap
at the door below.  Maisrie was in her room
upstairs.  Her grandfather was seated at the little
table in the parlour, drawing out in water-colour
a coat of arms; and he had already finished the
Bethune part of it—that is to say, the first and
fourth quarters of the shield were argent, with a
fesse between three mascles, or; and likewise he
had surmounted it with the crest—an otter's head,
erased, ppr.; but as the second and third quarters
were still vacant it was impossible to say with which
other family he proposed to claim alliance.  At this
moment Vincent made his appearance at the door,
looking very cheerful and good-humoured, and
modest withal; and he came into the room as if
he already felt quite at home there.

"I have taken a little liberty," said he, "with
regard to this evening.  I understood that you and
Miss Bethune had no engagement, and might think
of going to that same restaurant again; but then I
thought you might prefer a change; and so I have
ordered dinner at the——"  And he named a
well-known hotel in the neighbourhood of Burlington
Gardens.

"Oh, you have ordered dinner?"

"Yes, sir," said Vincent, respectfully; and then
seeing there was no objection, he went on with a
gayer air: "It does seem absurd that when people
want to meet each other, and to talk, and get
thoroughly acquainted, they must needs sit down
and eat together; but there is some sense in it too;
for of course we have all of us our different
occupations during the day; and dinner-time is the time at
which we all find ourselves free, so that the meeting
is easily arranged.  I hope Miss Bethune wasn't
fatigued after her long walk of last evening—"

"Oh, no, no," said her grandfather, rising and
going to the door.  "I must call and tell her we are
going out by and bye—"

"Yes, but of course she is coming too!" the
young man said quickly.

"If she likes—if she likes.  I myself should
prefer it.  I will ask her."

And on this occasion also, when she came
downstairs, Maisrie Bethune appeared in that simple
dress of cream-coloured cashmere; and again he
was struck by the alteration in her aspect; she was
no longer the shy and timid schoolgirl he had at
first imagined her to be, but a young woman, of
quite sufficient self-possession, tall, and elegant of
bearing, and with more than a touch of graceful
dignity in her manner.  This time she smiled as
she gave him her hand for a moment; and then
she turned away; always she seemed to assume
that this newly-found relationship existed only as
between her grandfather and the young man, that
she was outside of it, and only to be called in as an
adjunct, now and again when it happened to suit
them.

Nevertheless, as they by-and-bye walked away
down to Burlington Gardens, she was much more
animated and talkative than he had before seen
her; and he observed, too, that her grandfather
paid heed to her opinions.  Nay, she addressed the
younger of her two companions also, occasionally;
and now she was not afraid to let a smile dwell in
her eyes, when she chanced to turn to him.  He
was bewildered by it all; it was more, far more,
than he dared have hoped for; in fact he was the
last person in the world to suspect that his own
bearing—the buoyant unconscious audacity, the
winning frankness, as well as a certain youthful
modesty—was at the root of the mystery of this
sudden friendship.  For one thing, he had told
them a good deal about himself and his
circumstances, during that morning in Hyde Park and
during the previous afternoon and evening; and
there was something in the position of these three
folk, now brought together after wide wanderings
through the world, that seemed to invite confidence
and intimacy.  Then old George Bethune had an
excellent fund of good-fellowship, so long as the
present moment was an enjoyable one.

And, as it turned out, this evening proved to
be one of those enjoyable moments.  The small
festivity to which Vincent had invited his new
acquaintances was not in the least the haphazard
affair he had half-intimated it to be; he had
arranged it with care; they found themselves in a
pretty room, with plenty of flowers on the table;
while the little banquet itself was far more
elaborate, both as regards food and wine, than there was
any call for.  The old gentleman did not protest;
anything that happened—so long as it was
pleasant—was welcome to him; and he declared the
claret to be as excellent as any he had met with for
years back.  He could not understand why their
youthful host would not join him (as if it were likely
that Vincent was going to drink wine, now that he
discovered that Maisrie Bethune drank only water!)
but he had all the more for himself; and he waxed
eloquent and enthusiastic on his favourite theme.

"Why sir," said he, with a kind of proud
elation in his tone, "I myself heard Henry Ward
Beecher pronounce these words in the City Hall of
Glasgow—'I have been reared in a country whose
history is brief.  So vast is it, that one might travel
night and day for all the week, and yet scarcely
touch historic ground.  Its history is yet to be
written; it is yet to be acted.  But I come to this
land, which, though small, is as full of memories as
the heaven is full of stars, and almost as bright.
There is not the most insignificant piece of water
that does not make my heart thrill with some story
of heroism, or some remembered poem; for not
only has Scotland had the good fortune to have men
who knew how to make heroic history, but she has
reared those bards who have known how to sing
their deeds.  And every steep and every valley, and
almost every single league on which my feet have
trod, have made me feel as if I were walking in a
dream.  I never expected to find my eyes overflow
with tears of gladness that I have been permitted,
in the prime of life, to look upon this beloved
land.'  Well spoken—nobly spoken!  When I take my
granddaughter here to visit her native country—for
to that country she belongs, in all the essentials of
blood and tradition and descent—I hope she will be
in a similarly receptive mood; and will see, not
the bare hills, not the lonely islands, not the
desolate moors, but a land filled with the magic of
association, and consecrated by the love and
devotion of a thousand song-writers, known and unknown.
I will say with Johnson 'That man is little to be
envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon
the plain of Bannockburn, or whose piety would not
grow warmer among the ruins of Iona'—"

"Not Bannockburn: Marathon, wasn't it,
grandfather?" said Maisrie, in her gentle way.

"Well, well," he said, not heeding the interruption.
"'Almost every single league,' said Ward
Beecher; and that is true.  I could make a
pilgrimage throughout the length and breadth of
Scotland, guided by the finger of Scottish song.
Indeed, I have often thought I should like, if the
years were spared to me, to collect materials for a
volume—a splendid and magnificent volume—on
the Scotland of the Scotch songs and ballads.  The
words and the music are already there; and I would
have the pencil add its charm; so that Scotland, in
her noblest and fairest aspects, might be placed
before the stranger, and might be welcomed once
again by her own sons.  I would have the lonely
Braes o' Balwhidder, and Rob Roy's grave in the
little churchyard on the hillside; I would have
Tannahill's Arranteenie—that is on Loch Long side,
I think; and the Bonnie House o' Airlie:

   |  'It fell on a day, a bonnie summer's day,
   |  When the corn grew green and fairly,
   |  That the great Argyle, wi' a' his men,
   |  Cam' to plunder the bonnie house o' Airlie.'

Then the Vale of Yarrow—well, perhaps that would
have to be a figure subject—the grief-stricken
maiden bending over the body of her slain lover—

   |  'Pale though thou art, yet best, yet best beloved,
   |    O could my warmth to life restore thee!—
   |  Ye'd lie all night between my breasts;
   |    No youth lay ever there before thee.'

And Colonsay—Leyden's Colonsay—the haunted
island that mourns like a sea-shell—

   |  'And ever as the year returns,
   |    The charm-bound sailors know the day;
   |  For sadly still the mermaid mourns
   |    The lovely chief of Colonsay.'

Gala Water—" the old man continued, in a sort of
exalted rhapsody; and his eyes were absent, as if he
were beholding a succession of visions.  "Hunting
Tower—Craigie-burn Wood—the solitude sought
out by Bessie Bell and her girl companion when
they fled from the plague—Ettrick Banks—the
bush aboon Traquair—in short, an endless series!
And where the pencil may fail, imagination must
come in—

   |  'I see—but not by sight alone,
   |  Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;
   |  A ray of fancy still survives—
   |  Her sunshine plays upon thee!'

It would be something to do for the sake of 'puir
auld Scotland;' and think what an enchanted
wandering that would be for both Maisrie and
myself.  Tweed and Teviot—the silver Forth—the
stately Clyde: well, perhaps she would be better
pleased to gather a flower or two—a lucken-gowan
or a speedwell—on 'the bonnie banks o' Ayr.'"

"But, grandfather," Maisrie Bethune interposed,
"before you can begin such a book, or even think
of it, you know there is something else to be
done."

"I suppose it would be an expensive volume to
bring out?" Vincent suggested inquiringly.

"Oh, yes, yes," the old man said—and now he
had relinquished that rhapsodical strain, and had
assumed his usual dignified, not to say grandiose,
demeanour.  "The drawings must be done by the
first artists; they must not fall below the poetic
pitch of the old ballads and the still older airs.  It
would be an expensive book to bring out, no doubt;
but then it would be a noble undertaking; it would
be a sumptuous and valuable work.  I should think,
now," he went on, reflectively, "that there ought to
be a large paper edition—and perhaps five guineas
would not be too much to charge—quarto, I
mean—quarto—and five guineas for such a handsome
volume mightn't be too much—"

"Five guineas?" repeated Vincent.  "Well, sir,
if you choose to bring out the book by subscription,
I will undertake to get you fifty subscribers
for that edition."  And then he added recklessly,
"A hundred—I will assure you a hundred subscribers!"

"No, Mr. Harris," said Maisrie, and she addressed
herself in a more direct manner than she had ever
yet done to the young man.  "It is not to be
thought of.  My grandfather has work to do that he
must finish before entertaining any other schemes.
It would be simply wasting time to begin and
arrange about another book."

He felt himself silenced and humbled, he hardly
knew why.  Had she construed his proffered
assistance into an offer of charity, and resented it
accordingly?  But he could find no trace of offended
pride in the refined and gentle features when next
he ventured to look at her.  She had said her say;
and that was enough.  And her grandfather seemed
to know she was in the right; nothing further was
mentioned about the new proposal—at least at this
particular time.  Dessert had come; and the
business of choosing from among those abundant
fruits made a kind of break.

When at length they were about to depart, there
was no confusion about the bill, for Vincent
intimated to the old man that he had already arranged
about that; and Mr. Bethune seemed satisfied,
while Maisrie had passed on in front and did not
hear.  She was very light-hearted and talkative as
they walked away home.  Her protest against the
proposed publication, if it showed a little firmness
at the time, had left no pained feeling behind it;
she was now as blithe as a bird; to Vincent she
seemed to shed a radiance around her, as if she
were some supernatural being, as she passed through
those twilight streets.  Once she said something in
French—in Canadian French—to her grandfather;
and the young man thought that never in all his
life had he heard anything so sweet and fascinating
as the soft and blurred sound of the *r*'s.  He was
to hear a little more of that Canadian French on
this evening.  When they reached their lodgings,
the old gentleman again asked his young friend to
come in for a little while; the temptation was too
great; he yielded; and followed them up into the
dusky small parlour.

"Now we will have a serious smoke," said George
Bethune, with decision, as he took down his long
clay pipe.  "A cigarette after dinner is a mere
frivolity.  Maisrie, lass, bring over that box of
cigars for Mr. Harris."

But Mr. Harris firmly declined to smoke, even as
he had declined to take any wine: what was he
going to sacrifice next as a subtle tribute to
the exalted character of this young creature?
Maisrie Bethune seemed hardly to understand, and
was a little surprised; but now she had to go away
upstairs, to lay aside her things: so the two men
were left alone, to chat about the affairs of the day
until her return.

When she came down again, her grandfather said—

"Sing something, Maisrie."

"You know I can't sing, grandfather, but I never
refuse you, for it is not of any use," said she,
contentedly, as she took the violin out of its case.
"But Mr. Harris has had enough of Scotch songs
this evening.  I must try something else.  And
perhaps you may have heard the air in Canada," she
added, addressing the young man from out of the
partial darkness.

And now what was this new enchantment she was
about to disclose and practise?  In plain truth, she
had very little voice; but he did not notice that;
it was the curiously naive, and simple, and sincere
expression of tone that thrilled through his heart,
as she proceeded to recite rather than to sing the
well-known "*C' était une frégate,*" the violin aiding
her with its low and plaintive notes:

   |  *C' était une frégate*
   |  *(Mon joli coeur de rose)*
   |  *Dans la mer a touché*
   |  *(Joli coeur d' un rosier).*

And here again were those softly slurred *r*'s—not
sharply trilled, as in the English fashion—but
gentle and half-concealed, as it were.  The simple
story proceeded—

   |  *Y avait une demoiselle*
   |  *(Mon joli coeur de rose)*
   |  *Su' l' bord d' la mer pleurait,*
   |  *(Joli coeur d' un rosier).*

   |  *—Dites-moi donc, la belle,*
   |  *(Mon joli coeur de rose)*
   |  *Qu' a' vous à tant pleurer?*
   |  *(Joli coeur d' un rosier).*

   |  *—Je pleur; mon anneau d' or,*
   |  *(Mon joli coeur de rose)*
   |  *Dans la mer est tombé,*
   |  *(Joli coeur d' un rosier).*

Then he asks the weeping damsel what she would
give to any one who would find for her her ring of
gold that has fallen into the sea.

   |  *—Je suis trop pauvre fille,*
   |  *(Mon joli coeur de rose),*
   |  *Je ne puis rien donner,*
   |  *(Joli coeur d' un rosier).*

   |  *Qu' mon coeur en mariage*
   |  *(Mon joli coeur de rose)*
   |  *Pour mon anneau doré*
   |  *(Joli coeur d' un rosier).*

But the young man sitting there in the twilight
hardly heard further than that.  The phrase '*qu'
mon coeur en mariage*' had something more beautiful
in it than even the soft sound of the *r*'s as she
pronounced them; it dwelt in his heart with a
mysterious charm; even as she went on to tell how the
bold gallant who dived for the ring of gold was
drowned, what he still seemed to hear was "*Je ne
puis rien donner, qu' mon coeur en mariage;*" and
when she had finished, and there was silence, he
did not speak; there was a kind of bewilderment
in the tones of her voice; and he could not offer
her commonplace thanks.

"Now I am going to light the gas," she said,
cheerfully, as she laid aside her violin, "and,
grandfather, you can challenge Mr. Harris to a game of
chess, or draughts, or dominoes, whichever he likes
best, so that I may get to my work, for it cannot
always be playtime."

And so it was that, when the gas had been lit, she
returned to her own corner and to her needlework,
while her grandfather and Vincent took to
dominoes, the old man having his hot water and whisky
brought to him to accompany his second pipe.
Dominoes is a mechanical game; you can play well
enough even if there is the refrain of a song
ringing through your memory; the young man did not
care who won; and, indeed, he had quite forgotten
who was the victor as he shortly thereafter made his
way south through the lamp-lit streets, with his
lips half-trying to re-pronounce that strangely
fascinating phrase, "*qu' mon coeur en mariage—qu'
mon coeur en mariage*."

Well, this was but the beginning of a series of
evenings, until it came to be understood that these
three dined together each night, subsequently
returning to old George Bethune's rooms, for a little
music or dominoes before parting.  Vincent assumed
the management of these modest little merry-makings;
varied the scene of them as much as
possible; and so arranged matters that no financial
question came up to ask for Maisrie Bethune's
interference.  It is true, she sometimes seemed
inclined to remain at home, so as to leave the two
men greater freedom, perhaps; but he would not
hear of that; and his ever increasing intimacy now
lent him a franker authority.  He was high-handed
in his ways: she smiled, and yielded.

At last there came a proposition that was
somewhat startling in its boldness.  Cunningly he
deferred bringing it forward until the very end of the
evening, for then he knew that the old gentleman
would be more inclined to welcome any gay and
audacious scheme, without particularly weighing
pros and cons.  Accordingly having chosen his
opportunity, he informed them that he had been
offered the use of a house-boat during the Henley
week (which was literally true: he had been offered
it—for the sum of £30) and said that he had a great
mind to accept if only he could persuade Mr. Bethune
and his granddaughter to go down as his guests.

"I understood you to say," he continued, without
giving either of them time to reply, "that you had
never seen Henley at the regatta-time.  But it is
a thing you ought to see—it is the prettiest sight
in England—it is perfectly unique—there is nothing
else like it in the world.  And then they make
those house-boats so comfortable; it is simply a
small floating home; or, on the other hand, you
can sit outside, and be in the very midst of all the
fun.  There is no scramble—no crowd—no hustling—so
far as we are concerned; and we shall have
our own cook and steward.  If you do not care to
stay the whole week, we could go down on Tuesday
afternoon—the races begin on Wednesday—and
remain for the illuminations and fireworks on Friday
night.  It would be awfully good-natured of you
both; of course I could not think of going down
and occupying a house-boat by myself.  Now what
do you say, Miss Bethune?—I appeal first to you."

"Yes, what do you say, Maisrie?" the old man
said, seeing that his granddaughter hesitated; and
then he added with a condescending smile: "A
question of dress, is it?  I have heard that the
costumes at Henley are rather extravagant."

"Oh, I assure you, no," the young man protested
(he would have sworn that the sky was pea-green
if that would have helped.)  "They are quite
simple summer dresses—light in colour, of course—oh,
yes—but quite plain and simple: who would
take gorgeous gowns to go boating?"

"Very well, very well," Mr. Bethune said, with
an easy good-nature.  "I will answer for both
Maisrie and myself: we shall be delighted.  Let
us know the conditions; let us know what may be
expected of us; we are old travellers and ready for
anything.  And don't you be over particular about
your preparations, my young friend; we can rough
it; and indeed I'm afraid of late we've been falling
into somewhat too luxurious ways.  Not that I am
an anchorite; no—God forbid; if the present
moment commends itself, I welcome it; I see no
wisdom in schooling one's self to bear hardships
that may not arise.  Yes, I have heard of Henley—the
Thames in July—the brilliant company—"

"It is awfully kind of you," said Vincent, rising,
and preparing to go.  "I am sure you won't regret
it; it is the very prettiest thing in England.  And
to-morrow night I will let you know all the arrangements."

Full of joy was the heart of this young man as
he strode away down to Grosvenor Place; and
reckless and extravagant were the projects crowding
in upon his brain as to how he should play the part
of host.  For one thing, he had the wherewithal;
apart from the allowance given him by his father,
an uncle had died leaving him a considerable sum;
while his own personal habits were of the most
inexpensive kind; so that he had plenty of
money—too much money—to spend when any whim
entered his head.  And now, for the first time, old
George Bethune and the fair Maisrie were to be
openly and ostensibly his guests; and what was he
not going to do in the way of entertaining them?
If only he could make sure that Maisrie's cream-coloured
costume would go well with calceolarias?—then
with masses of calceolarias that house-boat
would be smothered from stem to stern!

Nor did the knowledge that Mrs. Ellison would
very likely be at Henley trouble him one bit.  He
was not ashamed of this recently-formed friendship;
no; rather he was ready to proclaim it to all the
world.  Supposing Mrs. Ellison, shrewd-eyed as she
was, were to come and inspect them, where could
she find two more interesting human beings—the
old man with his splendid nerve and proud spirit;
amidst all his misfortunes, and in his old age, too,
still holding his head erect; firm and unyielding as
his own Craig-Royston:—the young girl with her
pensive and mysterious beauty, her clear-shining,
timid eyes, her maidenly dignity, her patience with
the old man, and persuasive and affectionate
guidance?  Ashamed of this friendship?—he was more
inclined to parade it, to boast of it; he would have
scorned himself otherwise.  Of course (as he could
not hide from himself) Mrs. Ellison might be
inclined to speculate upon ulterior motives, and might
begin to ask what was to come of all this warmth
of friendship and constant association.  But any
future possibilities Vincent put away even from
himself; they were all too wild and strange as yet;
he was content with the fascination he found in
these pleasant little merry-makings, in the more
intimate companionship of the small parlour, in
listening, there or elsewhere and always, to Maisrie
Bethune's voice.  And perhaps it was only the
sweetness of that voice, and the softly murmured
*r*'s, that had vibrated through his heart when she
sang "*Je ne puis rien donner, qu' mon coeur en
mariage?*"  What other charm could lie in so
simple a phrase?  At all events, he thought he
would ask Maisrie to take her violin down to
Henley with her, just in case Mrs. Ellison should
some evening pay a visit to the *White Rose*.

It was a soft summer night, cool and fragrant after
the heat of the long July day; and here, under an
awning in the stern of the house-boat *White Rose*,
were George Bethune, his granddaughter Maisrie,
and Vincent Harris, looking out upon the magic
scene that stretched away from them on each hand
up and down the river.  All the dusk was on fire
with illuminations; the doors and windows of the
house-boats sent forth a dull golden glow; there
were coloured lamps, crimson, blue, and orange;
there were strings of Chinese lanterns that scarcely
moved in the faint stirring of wind; and now and
again an electric launch would go by—stealthily
and silently—with brilliant festoons of fierce white
lights causing it to look like some gigantic and
amazing insect irradiating the dark.  The smooth
surface of the stream quivered with reflections; here
and there a rowing boat glided along, with a cool
plash of oars; a gondola came into view and slowly
vanished—the white-clad gondolier visionary as a
ghost.  Everywhere there was a scent of flowers;
and on board this particular house-boat there was
but the one prevailing perfume; for the sole
decoration of the saloon consisted of deep crimson
roses—a heavy splendour against the white and
gold walls.  From some neighbouring craft came
the tinkle of a banjo; there was a distant hum of
conversation; the unseen reeds and waterlilies could
be imagined to be whispering in the silence.  Among
the further woods and meadows there was an
occasional moving light; no doubt the campers-out
were preparing to pitch their tents.

"Mr. Talkative of Prating-row is hardly wanted
here to-night," old George Bethune was saying,
unmindful of his own garrulous habits.  "Music is
better.  What is that they are singing over there,
Maisrie?"

"'The Canadian Boat Song,' grandfather."

"Oh, yes, of course: I thought it was familiar.
And very pretty it sounds, coming across the
water—though I do not know whether the air is modern
or old.  What I am certain of," he continued, raising
his voice slightly as he usually did when he was
about to discourse, "is that the finest national airs
are ancient beyond the imagination of man to
conceive.  No matter when words may have been
tacked on to them; the original melodies, warlike,
or pathetic, or joyous, were the voice of millions of
generations that passed away leaving us only these
expressions of what they had felt.  And if one could
only re-translate them!—if one could put back into
speech all the human suffering that found expression
in such an air as 'The Last Rose of Summer,'
wouldn't that electrify the world?  I wonder how
many millions of generations must have suffered
and wept and remembered ere that piteous cry could
have been uttered; and when I come to Tom Moore's
wretched trivialities—"

"Grandfather," interposed Maisrie Bethune,
quickly (for there were certain subjects that angered
him beyond endurance) "you must not forget to
show Mr. Harris that old play you found—with the
Scotch airs, I mean—"

"Yes, that is curious," said the old man, yielding
innocently.  "Curious, is it not, that long before
either Burns or Scott was born, a Scotchman named
Mitchell should have collected over fifty of the
best-known Scotch airs, and printed them, with
words of his own; and that he should have chosen
for the scene of his play the Borders of the
Highlands, so as to contrast the manners and customs of
the Highland chieftains and their fierce clansmen
with those of the Lowland lairds and the soldiery
sent to keep the peace between them.  The *Highland
Fair* was produced at Drury Lane about 1730, if I
remember aright; but I cannot gather whether
Ewen and Colin, and Alaster and Kenneth,
impressed the Londoners much.  To me the book is
valuable because of the airs—though I could wish
for the original songs instead of Mitchell's—"

Here Maisrie, seeing that her grandfather was
started on a safer subject, quietly rose; and at
the first pause she said—

"I see some of them are putting out their lights,
and that is a hint for me to be off.  I suppose we
shall be wakened early enough to-morrow morning
by the boats going by.  Good-night, Mr. Harris!
Good-night, grandfather!"

She shook hands with both, and kissed her
grandfather; then she passed into the glow of that
wonderful rose-palace, and made her way along to the
ladies' cabin, into which she disappeared.  Vincent
now lit a cigar—the first during this day.

But when old George Bethune resumed his monologue,
it was neither Highland clans nor Lowland
songs that concerned him; it was something that
proved to be a good deal more interesting to his
patient listener.  It was of Maisrie's youth that he
spoke, and that in a far more simple and natural way
than was his wont.  There were no genealogical
vauntings, no exalted visions of what she should be when
she came in for her rights; there were reminiscences
of her earlier years, and of his and her wanderings
together; and there was throughout a certain
wistfulness in his tone.  For once he talked without
striving for effect, without trying oratorically to
convince himself; and it is to be imagined how entirely
Vincent was engrossed by this simple recital.  Not
that there was any consecutive narrative.  The
young man could only vaguely gather that Maisrie's
father had been a railway-engineer; that he had
married a young Scotch lady in Baltimore before
going out west; that Maisrie had been born in
Omaha; that shortly thereafter her mother died;
then came the collapse of certain speculations her
father had been led into, so that the widower,
broken in heart and fortune, soon followed his young
wife, leaving their child to the care of her only
surviving relative.  Whether there were some
remains of the shattered fortune, or whether friends
subscribed to make up a small fund for them, it
appeared that the old man and his granddaughter
were not quite penniless; for he took credit to
himself that he had spent nearly all their little
income, arising from this unspecified source, on
Maisrie's education.

"I wish to have her fitted for any sphere to
which she might be called," he went on, in a
musing kind of way.  "And I hope I have
succeeded.  She has had the best masters I could
afford; and something of her teaching I have taken
upon myself.  But, after all, that is not of the
greatest importance.  She has seen the world—far
more than most of her years; and she has not been
spoiled by the contact.  I could have wished her,
perhaps, to have had more of the companionship of
her own sex; but that was not often practicable, in
our wandering life.  However, she has an intuitive
sympathy that stands for much; and if in society—which
is not much in our way—she might show
herself shy and reserved, well, I, for one, should not
complain: that seems to me more to be coveted
than confidence and self-assertion.  As for outward
manner she has never wanted any school-mistress
other than her own natural tact and her own
refinement of feeling; she is a gentlewoman at heart;
rudeness, coarseness, presumption would be
impossible to her—"

"The merest stranger can see that," Vincent
ventured to say, in rather a low voice.

"And thus so far we have come through the
world together," the old man continued, in the same
meditative mood.  "What I have done I have done
for the best.  Perhaps I may have erred: what
could I tell about the uprearing of a young girl?
And it may be that what she is now she is in spite
of what I have done for her and with her—who
knows such mysteries?  As for the future, perhaps
it is better not to look to it.  She is alone; she is
sensitive; the world is hard."

"I know many who would like to be her friends,"
the young man said, breathlessly.

"Sometimes," old George Bethune continued,
slowly and thoughtfully, "I wonder whether I have
done my best.  I may have built on false hopes—and
taught her to do the same.  I see young
women better equipped for the battle of the world,
if it is to come to that.  Perhaps I have been selfish
too; perhaps I have avoided looking to the time
when she and I must in the natural course of things
be separated.  We have been always together; as
one, I might say; the same sunlight has shone on
us, we have met the same storms, and not much
caring, so long as we were the one with the other.
But then—the years that can be granted me now
are but few; and she has no kinsman to whom she
can go, even to glean in the fields and ask for a
pitcher of water.  And when I think of her—alone—among
strangers—my Maisrie—"

His voice choked—but only for a moment.  He
suddenly sprang to his feet, and flung his arms
in the air, as if he would free himself from this
intolerable burden of despondency and doubt.

"Why," said he, in accents of scornful impatience,
"have I gone mad, or what pestilent thing is this!
*Sursum corda*!  We have faced the world together,
she and I, and no one has ever yet found us
downhearted.  'We've aye been provided for, and sae
will we yet': I do not mean as regards the common
necessities of life—for these are but of small
account—but the deeper necessities of sympathy
and hope and confidence.  Stand fast,
Craig-Royston!—'this rock shall fly, from its firm base
as soon as I!'  Well, my young friend," he
continued, quite cheerfully and bravely, "you have
seen me in a mood that is not common with me:
you will say nothing about it—to her, especially.
She puts her trust in me; and so far, I think, I
have not failed her.  I have said to her 'Come the
three corners of the world in arms, and we shall
shock them'; ill fortune buffets uselessly against
'man's unconquerable mind.'  She knows the race
she comes of, and the motto of that race:
Craig-Royston holds its front!  Well, well, now, let me
thank you for this beautiful evening; and on her
behalf too; she is at the time when the mind
should be stored with pleasant memories.  Perhaps
I have been over-communicative, and made you
the victim of idle fears; but there will be no more
of that; to-morrow you shall find me in my right
mind."

He held out his hand.  The young man did not
know what to say—there was so much to say!  He
could only make offer of some further little
hospitalities, which Mr. Bethune declined; then the
steward was summoned, to put out the lamps and
make other preparations, so that the *White Rose*
should fold its petals together, for the slumber of
the night.  And presently a profound peace reigned
from stem to stern; and the last plashing of the
oars outside had died away.

But it was not to sleep that Vincent devoted the
early hours of this night and morning.  His mind
was tossed this way and that by all kinds of moods
and projects, the former piteous and the latter
wildly impracticable.  He had never before fully
realised how curiously solitary was the lot of these
two wanderers, how strange was their isolation, how
uncertain was their future.  And while the old
man's courage and bold front provoked his admiration,
he could not help looking at the other side of
the shield: what was to become of her, when her
only protector was taken from her?  He knew that
they were none too well off, those two; and what
would she do when left alone?  But if on the very
next day he were to go to Mrs. Ellison and borrow
£10,000 from her, which he would have mysteriously
conveyed to old George Bethune?  He could repay
the money, partly by the sacrifice of his own small
fortune, and partly by the assigning over of the
paternal allowance; while he could go away to
Birmingham, or Sheffield, or wherever the place
was, and earn his living by becoming Mr. Ogden's
private secretary.  They need never know from
whom this bounty came, and it would render them
secure from all the assaults of fortune.  Away up
there in the Black Country he would think of
them; and it would lighten the wearisome toil of
the desk if he could imagine that Maisrie Bethune
had left the roar and squalor of London, and was
perhaps wandering through these very Thames-side
meadows, or floating in some white-garnitured boat,
under the shade of the willows.  There would be
rest for the pilgrims at last, after their
world-buffetings.  And so he lay and dreamed and pitied
and planned, until in the window of the small
state-room there appeared the first blue-gray of the
dawn, about which time he finally fell asleep.

But next morning all was briskness and activity
around them—flags flying, coloured awnings being
stretched, pale swirls of smoke rising from the
stove-pipes, the pic-nickers in the meadows lighting their
spirit-lamps for the breakfast tea.  The sun was
shining brightly, but there was a cool breeze to
temper the heat; the surface of the stream was
stirred into silver; the willows and rushes were
shivering and swaying; a scent of new-mown hay
was in the air.  Already there were plenty of craft
afloat, on business or on pleasure bent; early visits
being paid, or masses of flowers, ferns, and palms
being brought along for purchasers.  Maisrie was
the first to be up and out; then old George Bethune
could be heard gaily singing in his state-room, as
an accompaniment to his toilet—

   |  "Hey, Jonnie Cope, are ye waukin yet,
   |  And are your drums a-beatin yet,
   |  If ye were waukin, I would wait
   |  To meet Jonnie Cope in the morning?"

Finally when Vincent, with many apologies for
being late, made his appearance outside, he found
the old man comfortably seated in the stern-sheets,
under the pink and white awning, reading a
newspaper he had procured somewhere, while Maisrie
was on the upper-deck of the house-boat watering
the flowers with a can that she had got from the
steward.

And indeed to this young man it appeared a
truly wonderful thing that these three, some little
while thereafter, in the cool twilight of the saloon,
should be seated at breakfast together; they seemed
to form a little family by themselves, isolated and
remote from the rest of the world.  They forgot the
crowded Thames outside and the crowded meadows;
here there was quiet, and a charming companionship;
a band that was playing somewhere was so distant
as to be hardly audible.  Then the saloon itself was
charming; for though the boat was named the
*White Rose*, there was a good deal of pale pink
in its decorations: the flutings and cornice were
pink where they were not gold, and pink were
the muslin curtains drawn round the small windows;
while the profusion of deep crimson roses all round
the long room, and the masses of grapes and
pineapples on the breakfast-table made up a picture
almost typical of summer, in the height of its
luxuriance and shaded coolness.

"This seems very nice," said the young host,
"even supposing there were no river and no racing.
I don't see why a caravan like this shouldn't be put
on wheels and taken away through the country.
There is an idea for you, Mr. Bethune, when you
set out on your pilgrimage through Scotland;
wouldn't a moveable house of this kind be the very
thing for Miss Bethune and you?—you could set it
afloat if you wanted to go down a river, or put it
on a lorry when you wanted to take the road."

"I'm afraid all this luxury would be out of place
in 'Caledonia, stern and wild,'" the old man said.
"No, no; these things are for the gay south.  When
Maisrie and I seek out the misty solitudes of the
north, and the graves of Renwick and Cargill, it
will be on foot; and if we bring away with us some
little trifle to remind us of Logan's streams and
Ettrick's shaws, it will be a simple thing—a
bluebell or a bit of yellow broom.  I have been thinking
that perhaps this autumn we might begin—"

"Oh, no, grandfather," Maisrie interposed at once.
"That is impossible.  You know you have the
American volume to do first.  What a pity it would
be," she went on, with an insidious and persuasive
gentleness which the young man had seen her adopt
before in humouring her grandfather, "if some one
else were to bring out a book on the same subject
before you.  You know no one understands it so
thoroughly as you do, grandfather: and with your
extraordinary memory you can say exactly what
you require; so that you could send over and get
the materials you want without any trouble."

"Very well, very well," the old man said, curtly.
"But we need not talk business at such a time as
this."

Now there was attached to the *White Rose* a
rowing boat; and a very elegant rowing-boat it
was, too, of varnished pine; and by and bye Vincent
proposed to his two guests that they should get
into the stern-sheets, and he would take a short
pair of sculls, and pull them up to the bridge, to
show them the other house-boats, and the people,
and the fun of the fair generally.

"But wouldn't you take the longer oars," said
Maisrie, looking down into the shapely gig, "and
let me have one?"

"Oh, would you like that?" he said, with pleasure
in his eyes.  "Yes, by all means, if you care to row.
It is a light boat though it's long; you won't find
it hard pulling.  By the way, I hunted about
everywhere to get a gondola for you, and I couldn't."

"But who told you I had ever tried an oar in
a gondola?" she asked, with a smile.

"Why, you yourself: was I likely to forget it?"
he said reproachfully.

And oh! wasn't he a proud young man when he
saw this rare and radiant creature—clad all in
white she was, save for a bunch of yellow king-cups
in her white sailor hat, and a belt of dull gold satin
at her waist—when he saw her step down into the
boat, and take her place, and put out the stroke oar
with her prettily shaped hands.  Her grandfather
was already in the stern-sheets, in possession of the
tiller-ropes.  When they moved off into mid-stream,
it was very gently, for the river was already
beginning to swarm; and he observed that she
pulled as one accustomed to pulling, and with ease;
while, as he was responsible for keeping time, they
had nothing to be ashamed of as they slowly moved
up the course.  Indeed, they were only paddling;
sometimes they had to call a halt altogether, when
there was a confusion; and this not unwelcome
leisure they devoted to an observation of the various
crews—girls in the lightest of summer costumes,
young men in violent blazers—or to a covert
inspection of the other house-boats, with their
parterres and festoons of flowers, their huge Japanese
sun-shades and tinted awnings, and the brilliant
groups of laughing and chatting visitors.

"Oh, Mr. Harris, do look—isn't that a pretty
one!" Maisrie exclaimed, in an undertone.

He glanced in the direction indicated, and there
beheld a very handsome house-boat, all of rich-hued
mahogany, its chief decoration being flowerboxes in
blue tiles filled with marguerites.  At the same
instant he found that a pair of eyes were fixed on
him—eyes that were familiar—and the next moment
he knew that Mrs. Ellison, from the upper deck of
that mahogany house-boat, was regarding him and
his companions with an intense curiosity.  But so
swift was her scrutiny, and so impassive her face,
that ere he could guess at the result of her
investigation she had made him a formal little bow
and turned away to talk to her friends.  Of course,
with one hand on the oar he raised his hat with the
other: but the effect of this sudden recognition was
to leave him rather breathless and bewildered.  It
is true, he had half expected her to be there; but
all the same he was not quite prepared; and—and
he was wondering what she was thinking now.
However, the officials were beginning to clear the
course for the first race; so the gig was run in
behind one of the tall white poles; and there the
small party of three remained until the rival crews
had gone swiftly by, when it was permitted them to
return to the *White Rose*.

After luncheon he said he would leave his guests
to themselves for a little while, as he wished to pay
a visit to a friend he had seen on one of the other
house-boats; then he jumped into the gig, made his
way along to the *Villeggiatura*, got on board, went
up the steps, and found himself among a crowd of
people.  Mrs. Ellison, noticing him, discreetly left
the group she was with, and came to him, taking
him in a measure apart.

"Wait a moment, Vin," she said, regarding the
young man.  "If you wish it—if you prefer it—I
have seen nothing."

"What do you mean, aunt!" he said, with some
haughty inclination to anger.  "Why should I seek
any concealment?  I want you to come along that
I may introduce to you two friends of mine."

Instinctively she seemed to draw back a
little—almost as if she were afraid.

"Oh, no, thanks, Vin.  No, thanks.  Please leave
me out."

"Why?" he demanded.

The pretty young widow was embarrassed and
troubled; for she knew the fiery nature of young
men; and did not want to provoke any quarrel by
an unguarded expression.

"Well—it is simply this, you know—they are
strangers—I mean—I suppose that neither your
father nor any of the family have met them—they
seemed somehow like strangers—unusual
looking—and—and I shouldn't like to be the first.
Leave me out, there's a good boy!"

"Why?" he demanded again.

So she was driven to confession.

"Well, look here, Vin; I may be wrong; but
aren't these new friends somehow connected with
your being so much away from home of late—with
your being in those lodgings?  Was it there you
made their acquaintance?"

"If you want to know, I saw them first at Lord
Musselburgh's," said he with an amazing audacity;
for although the statement was literally true, it was
entirely misleading.

And apparently it staggered the pleasant-eyed
young widow.

"Oh, at Lord Musselburgh's?" said she, with a
distinct (but cautious) change of manner.  "Oh,
really.  Lord Musselburgh's.  But why should you
want to introduce me to them, Vin?"

"Because," said he, "they have never met any
member of our family: and as you are the most
goodnatured and the prettiest, I want to produce a
favourable impression at the outset."

She laughed and was not displeased.

"There are some other qualities that seem to
characterise our family—impudence for one," she
observed.  "Well, come along, then, Vin: where
are your friends?"

"In a house-boat down there—the *White Rose*."

"The *White Rose*?  I noticed it yesterday—very
pretty—whose is it?"

"Mine for the present; I rented it for the week,"
he replied.

"Who are the other members of your party?"

"None—only those two."

But here she paused at the top of the steps;
and said in an undertone—

"Really, Vin, this is too much!  You, a young
man entertaining those two—and no lady
chaperon—"

He turned and looked at her, with straight eyes.

"Oh, it's quite right," she said, hastily.  "It's
quite right, of course—but—but so much *en
évidence*—so prominent—people might talk—"

"I never try to hinder people from talking," said
he, with a certain scorn.  "And if they busy
themselves with my small affairs, they are welcome
to ring their discoveries from the tops of the
steeples.  I did not ask anybody's permission when
I invited two friends of mine, who had never been
to Henley before, to be my guests during the
regatta-week."

"Of course not, of course not," she said, gently;
"but you are doing it in such a marked way—"

"Come, come, aunt," said he, "it isn't like you
to niggle about nothing.  You are not a prude;
you have too much goodnature—and too much
common sense.  And I don't want you to go on
board the *White Rose* with any kind of prejudice in
your mind."

They could not get away just then, however,
for the course was being cleared for the next race;
so they lingered there until they saw, far away on
the open river, two small objects like water-insects,
with slender quick-moving legs, coming rapidly
along.  The dull murmur of the crowd became
a roar as the boats drew nearer.  Then the needle-like
craft shot by, almost neck and neck; and loud
were the shouts that cheered this one or that;
while straining eyes followed them along to the
goal.  The sudden wave of enthusiasm almost
immediately subsided; the surface of the river was
again being crowded by the boats that had been
confined behind the white poles; and now Vincent
got his fair companion down into the gig and,
with some little difficulty and delay, rowed her
along to the *White Rose*.

He was very anxious as he conducted her on
board; but he affected a splendid carelessness.

"Mr. Bethune," said he, "let me introduce you
to my aunt, Mrs. Ellison—Miss Bethune,
Mrs. Ellison: now come away inside, and we'll get some
tea or strawberries or something—racing isn't
everything at Henley—

"It isn't anything at all, as far as I have seen,"
said Mrs. Ellison, goodhumouredly, as she followed
her nephew into the saloon.  "Well, this is very
pretty—very pretty indeed—one of the simplest
and prettiest—so cool-looking.  I hear this is your
first visit to Henley," she continued addressing the
old man, when they had taken their seats:
Vincent meanwhile, bustling about to get wine and
biscuits and fruit, for the steward had gone
ashore.

"It is," said he, "and I am glad that my
granddaughter has seen it in such favourable
circumstances.  Although she has travelled much, I doubt
whether she has ever seen anything more charming,
more perfect in its kind.  We missed the Student's
Serenade at Naples last year; but that would have
been entirely different, no doubt; this is a vast
water picnic, among English meadows, at the
fairest time of the year, and with such a brilliancy
of colour that the eye is delighted in every
direction."

He was self-possessed enough (whatever their
eagerly solicitous young host may have been); and
he went on, in a somewhat lofty and sententious
fashion, to describe certain of the great public
festivals and spectacles he had witnessed in various
parts of the world.  Mrs. Ellison was apparently
listening, as she ate a strawberry or two; but in
reality she was covertly observing the young girl
(who sate somewhat apart) and taking note of every
line and lineament of her features, and even every
detail of her dress.  Vincent brought Mr. Bethune
a tumbler of claret with a lump of ice in it; he
drained a deep draught; and resumed his story
of pageants.  Maisrie was silent, her eyes averted:
the young man asked himself whether the beautiful
profile, the fine nostrils, the sensitive mouth, would
not plead for favour, even though she did not speak.
It seemed a thousand pities that her grandfather
should be in this garrulous mood.  Why did not
Mrs. Ellison turn to the girl direct?—he felt sure
there would be an instant sympathy between those
two, if only Maisrie would appeal with her wonderful,
true eyes.  What on earth did anyone want to
know about the resplendent appearance of the
White Cuirassiers of the Prussian Guard, as they
rode into Prague a week or two after the battle of
Königgrätz, with their dusty and swarthy faces and
their copper-hued breastplates lit up by the
westering sun?

But, on the other hand, Mrs. Ellison was not
displeased by this one-sided conversation; quite
the contrary; she wanted to know all about these
strange people with whom her nephew had taken
up; and the more the old man talked the better
she resented the intervention of a race which
Master Vin dragged them all away to see; and
as soon as it was over—they were now seated in the
stern-sheets of the boat—she turned to Mr. Bethune
with a question.

"I understand," she said, in a casual sort of way,
"that you know Lord Musselburgh?"

At this Maisrie looked up startled.

"Oh, yes," said her grandfather, in his serene
and stately fashion.  "Oh, yes.  A most promising
young man—a young man who will make his mark.
Perhaps he is riding too many hobbies; and yet it
might not be prudent to interfere and advise; a
young man in his position is apt to be hot-headed—"

"Mrs. Ellison," interposed Maisrie, "we are only
slightly acquainted with Lord Musselburgh—very
slightly indeed.  The fact is, he was kind enough
to interest himself in a book, that my grandfather
hopes to bring out shortly."

"Ob, really," said the pretty widow with a most
charming smile (perhaps she was glad of this
opportunity of talking to the young lady herself)
"and may I ask—pardon my curiosity—what the
subject is."

"It is a collection of poems written by
Scotchmen living in America and Canada," answered
Maisrie, quite simply.  "My grandfather made the
acquaintance of several of them, and heard of
others; and he thought that a volume of extracts,
with a few short biographical notices, might be
interesting to the Scotch people over here.  For it is
about Scotland that they mostly write, I think, and
of their recollections—perhaps that is only natural."

"And when may we expect it?" was the next question.

Maisrie turned to her grandfather.

"Oh, well," the old man made answer, with an
air of magnificent unconcern, "that is difficult to
say.  The book is not of such great importance; it
may have to stand aside for a time.  For one thing,
I should most likely have to return to the other
side to collect materials; whereas, while we are
here in the old country, there are so many
opportunities for research in other and perhaps more
valuable directions, that it would be a thousand
pities to neglect them.  For example, now," he
continued, seeing that Mrs. Ellison listened meekly,
"I have undertaken to write for my friend
Carmichael of the *Edinburgh Chronicle* a series of
papers on a branch of our own family that attained
to great distinction in the Western Isles during the
reign of the Scotch Jameses—the learned Beatons
of Islay and Mull."

"Oh, indeed," said Mrs. Ellison, affecting much
interest.

"Yes," resumed old George Bethune, with much
dignified complacency, "it will be a singular history
if ever I find time to trace it out.  The whole of
that family seem to have been regarded with a kind
of superstitious reverence; all their sayings were
preserved; and even now, when a proverb is quoted
in the Western Isles, they add, 'as the sage of
Mull said' or 'as the sage of Islay said.'  For
*ullahm*, I may inform you, Mrs.—Mrs.—"

"Ellison," she said, kindly.

"Mrs. Ellison—I beg your pardon—my hearing
is not what it was.  *Ullahm*, in the Gaelic tongue
means at once a Doctor of Medicine and a wise
man—"

"They distinguish between the terms in
English," put in Vincent.

"—and doctors most of them appear to have
been," continued the old man, quite oblivious of
interruption: indeed he seemed to be reading
something out of his memory, rather than addressing
particularly any one of his audience.  "A certain
Hector Beaton, indeed, got a considerable grant in
Islay for having cured one of the Jameses when all
the Edinburgh Faculty had failed; and I myself
have seen in the island of Iona the tombstone of
the last of the Mull doctors of the name, who
died so late as 1657.  *Hic jacet Johannes Betonus
Maclenorum familiæ Medicus*: no doubt there must
be some mention of those Beatons in the archives
of the various families of Maclean in Mull.  Then I
daresay I could get a drawing of the tombstone—though
I can remember the inscription well enough.
The coat of arms, too, has the three mascles of the
Bethunes—"

"Of the Bethunes?—then you are of the same
family?" said Mrs. Ellison, this time with a little
genuine curiosity.

But the interruption had the effect of rousing
him from his historical reverie.

"I would rather say," he observed, with some
stiffness, "that they were originally of our family.
The Norman de Bethune would easily be changed
into the Scotch Beaton."

"Then there was Mary Beaton, of the Queen's
Maries," Mrs. Ellison suggested.

But at this the old man frowned: he did not
wish any fictitious characters brought into these
authentic annals.

"An idle tale—a popular rhyme," said he.
"There is no real foundation for the story of Mary
Hamilton that ever I could get hold of.  Of course
there may have been a Mary Beaton at Queen
Mary's court—what more likely?—and Mary
Beaton would come trippingly to the popular
tongue in conjunction with Mary Seton; but that
is all.  It is with real people, and important people,
I shall have to deal when I get to the Advocates
Library in Edinburgh."

"Oh, yes, certainly—of course—I quite understand,"
she said, humbly.  And then she rose.
"Well, I must be getting back to my friends, Vin,
or they will think I have slipped over the side and
been drowned."

"But won't you stay to dinner, aunt?" said he.
"I wish you would!"

"Oh, no, thanks, I really couldn't," she answered
with a sudden earnestness that became more
intelligible to him afterwards.  "I couldn't run away
from my hosts like that."  Then she turned to
Mr. Bethune and his granddaughter.  "By the way,"
she said, "Lord Musselburgh is coming down
to-morrow—merely for the day—and he will be
on board the *Villeggiatura*.  Would you all of
you like to come along and have a look over
the boat; or shall I send him to pay you a visit
here?"

It was Maisrie who replied—with perfect self-composure.

"Our acquaintance with Lord Musselburgh is so
very slight, Mrs. Ellison," said she, "that it would
hardly be worth while making either proposal.  I
doubt whether he would even remember our names."

Whereupon the young widow bade good-bye to
Maisrie with a pretty little smile; the old
gentleman bowed to her with much dignity; and then she
took her seat in the stern of the gig, while her
nephew put out the sculls.  When they were well
out of hearing, Mrs. Ellison said—with a curious
look in her eyes of perplexity and half-frightened
amusement—

"Vin, who is that old man?"

"Well, you saw, aunt," he made answer.

"Ob, yes, I saw.  I saw.  But I am none the
wiser.  I could not make him out at all.  Sometimes
I thought he was a self-conceited old donkey,
who was simply gabbling at random; and again he
seemed really to believe what he was saying, about
his connection with those Beatons and de Bethunes
and the Scotch kings.  But there's something
behind it all, Vin; I tell you there is; and I can't
make it out.  There's something mysterious about him—"

"There's nothing mysterious at all!" he exclaimed,
impatiently.

"But who is he, then?" she persisted.  "What
is he?  Where is his family?  Where are his relatives?"

"I don't think he has any, if it comes to that,
except his granddaughter," her nephew replied.

"What does he do, then?  How does he exist?"

He was beginning to resent this cross-examination;
but yet he said civilly enough—

"I am not in the habit of making inquiries about
the income of everyone I meet; but I understand
they have some small sum of money between
them—not much: and then he has published books; and
he writes for the *Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle*.  Is
that enough?"

"Where does he live?"

"In Mayfair."

"I don't believe a word of it!" she said, and she
even ventured to laugh in a half-embarrassed way.
"I believe he dwells in a cave—he is a troglodyte—he
comes out at dusk—and wanders about with a
lantern and a pickaxe.  Really, when I looked at
his shaggy eyebrows, and his piercing eyes, and his
venerable beard, I thought he must be some Druid
come to life again—or perhaps one of those
mythical island-doctors surviving from the
fourteenth century—"

"At all events, aunt," Vincent said, with an
ominous distinctness of tone, "his age and what he
has come through might procure for him a little
respect.  It isn't like you to jeer and jibe simply
because a man is old—"

"My dear boy, I am not jibing and jeering!"
she protested.  "I tell you I am puzzled.  There's
something about that old man I can't make out."

"How could you expect to understand anybody—in
half-an-hour's talk at Henley Regatta!" he said,
indignantly.  "I gave you the opportunity of
getting to know them both, if only you had come along
this evening, and spent some time with them.  I
am not aware that either of them wants to conceal
anything.  They are not ashamed of their poverty.
Perhaps the old man talks too much: you, at least,
pretended to find what he said interesting.  And as
for the girl, no doubt she was silent: she isn't used
to be stared at and examined by critical and
unsympathetic eyes."

The young widow elevated her brows: here was
something unexpected!

"Vin Harris," she said, solemnly, "are you
quarrelling with me because—because I am not
glamoured?  Is it as bad as that?  If so, then I
am extremely glad I did not accept your invitation
for this evening.  I am compromised far enough
already—"

"What do you mean by compromised?" he demanded.

But just at this moment she had to call to him
to look out, for they had almost arrived at the
*Villeggiatura*.  He glanced over his shoulder, pulled
a stroke with his right oar, shipped the other, and
then, having gripped the stern of the house-boat,
he affixed the painter of the gig, and, letting her
back fall into the stream, returned to the thwart he
had occupied.

"I wish to ask you, aunt," said he, in a sufficiently
stiff and formal tone, "how you consider you
have been compromised through meeting any friends
of mine."

"Oh," said she, half inclined to laugh, yet a little
bit afraid too, "don't ask me.  It isn't as serious as
that—I mean, I didn't think you would take it
seriously.  No doubt it's all right, Vin, your choosing
your own friends; and I have nothing to say against
them; only I would rather you left me out, if you
don't mind.  You see, I don't know your intentions—"

"Supposing I have none?" he demanded again.

"Well, no one can say what may happen," the
young widow persisted; "and I should not like to
be appealed to—Now, now, Vin, don't be so
passionate!—have I said a single word against your
new friends?  Not one.  I only confess that I'm a
selfish and comfort-loving woman, and I don't wish
to be drawn into any family strife.  There may be
no family strife?  Very well; so much the better.
But my having no further acquaintance with
Mr. Bethune and Miss Bethune—my having no
knowledge of them whatever, for it practically comes to
that—cannot injure them; and leaves me free from
responsibility.  Now don't quarrel with me, Vin;
for I will not allow it; I have been talking common
sense to you—but I suppose that is what no man of
twenty-five understands."

He hauled up the gig to the stern of the house-boat,
as an intimation that she could step on board
when she chose.

"There," said she, as she gave him her hand in
parting, "I see I have offended you; but what I
have said has been for your sake as well as mine."

Well, he was vexed, disappointed, and a little
inclined to be angry.  But all that darkness fled
from his spirit—he forgot all about Mrs. Ellison's
friendly monitions—he had no care for any
speculations as to the future—when he was back again in
the *White Rose*, sitting by Maisrie Bethune, he and
she together looking abroad on the gay crowd, and
the boats, and the trembling willows, and the
slow-moving skies now growing warmer with the
afternoon sun.  Then, when the last of the races was
over, came dinner; and as twilight stole over the
river and the meadows, the illuminations began, the
rows of coloured lanterns showing one after the
other, like so many fire-flies in the dusk.  Of course
they were sitting outside now—on this placid
summer night—in fairyland.

But something far more strange and wonderful
happened to him the next morning; and that was
his first *tête-à-tête* conversation with Maisrie Bethune.
It was quite unexpected, and even unsought; nay,
when he stepped outside and found that she was
alone on deck, he would have shrank back, had that
been possible, rather than break in upon her
solitude.  For even here at Henley, during the
regatta-time, which may be regarded as the High Festival
of Joyance and Flirtation, there was no thought of
pretty and insidious love-making in this young
man's head or heart.  There was something
mysteriously remote and reserved about this isolated
young creature, whose very beauty was of a strangely
pensive and wistful kind.  Even the gentle
self-possession and the wisdom beyond her years she
showed at times seemed to him a pathetic sort of
thing; he had a fancy that during her childhood
she never had had the chance of playing with young
children.

But it was too late to retreat; and indeed she
welcomed him with a pleasant smile as she bade
him good morning.  It was he who was embarrassed.
He talked to her about the common things
surrounding them, while anxiously casting about for
something better fitting such a rare opportunity.
And at last he said—

"Yes, I am sure your grandfather and I get on
very well.  And I have been wondering whether,
when you and he make that pilgrimage through
Scotland, he would let me accompany you."

In her beautiful and child-like eyes there was
a swift flash of joy that made his heart leap, so
direct and outspoken an expression it was of her
gladness to think of such a thing; but instantly
she had altered her look, and a faint flush of colour
had overspread her face—the pale wild-rose had
grown pink.

"Your way of travelling and ours are so different,"
the said, gently.

"Oh, but," said he, with eagerness, "you don't
understand how the idea of a long wandering on
foot has fascinated me: why, that would be the
whole charm of it!  You don't know me at all yet.
You think I care for the kind of thing that prevails
here—that I can't get on without pine-apples and
chairs with gilt backs?  Why—but I don't want
to talk about myself at all: if you would let me
come with you on that pilgrimage you would find
out a little.  And what an opportunity it will be,
to go with your grandfather: history, poetry, and
romance all brought together: Scotland will be a
wonderful country for you before you have done
with it.  And—and—you see—I have gone on
pedestrian excursions before—I have a pretty broad
back—I can carry things.  You might engage me
as porter; for even when you send your luggage
on, there will be a few odds and ends to fill a
knapsack with; and I can tramp like any gaberlunzie."

She smiled a little, and then said more seriously—

"I am glad to have the chance of speaking to
you about that scheme of my grandfather's; because,
Mr. Harris, you must try to dissuade him from it as
much as possible."

"Dissuade him?"

"Yes," said she, quietly.  "You must have seen
how completely my grandfather lives in a world
of imagination, and how one thing captivates him
after another, especially if it is connected with
Scotland and Scottish song.  And I have no doubt
he would write a beautiful book about such a tour
as that; for who knows more about all the places
and the legends and ballads?  It would be a
pleasure for me too—I have dreamed of it many a time.
But it is impossible for the present; and it will be
a kindness to me, Mr. Harris, if you will not
encourage him in it.  For the fact is," she continued,
with a little embarrassment, "my grandfather has
undertaken to write something else—and—and he
is under personal obligations about it—and he must
not be allowed to forget them."

"Oh, yes, I quite understand," Vincent said.
"I have heard of that volume about the Scotch
poets in America.  Well, you know what your
grandfather says, that he would have to go to the
other side to collect materials; while, being here
in this country just now, he might as well take you
to those scenes and places that would make up
another book, to be written subsequently.
However, I have no doubt you are right.  The
possibility of my going along with you two on such an
excursion has been a wonderful thing for me to
speculate on; but whatever you wish, that is enough.
I am against the Scotch trip now, so far as I have
any right to speak."

She was looking at him enquiringly, and yet
diffidently, as if she were asking herself how far
she might confide in him.

"Perhaps you have not noticed it, Mr. Harris,"
she added, still regarding him, "but my
grandfather has a strange faculty for making himself
believe things.  I daresay, if he only planned the
American book, he could convince himself that he
had written it, and so got rid of those—those
obligations.  Well, you will help me, will you
not?—for I am anxious to see it done; and he may say
I am too young and too ignorant to give advice—as
I am—"

"Why," said Vincent, almost indignantly, "do
you think I cannot see how you guide and lead
him always, and with such a tact and wisdom and
gentleness as I never beheld anywhere!"

Maisrie flashed downright red this time; but she
sought to conceal her confusion by saying quickly—

"Then again you must not misunderstand me,
Mr. Harris; you must not think I am saying
anything against my grandfather; I am only telling
you of one little peculiarity he has.  Saying
anything against him!—I think I could not well do
that; for he has been goodness itself to me since
ever I can remember anything.  There is nothing
he would not sacrifice for my sake; sometimes it is
almost painful to me to see an old man, who should
be the petted one and the cared for, so ready to
give up his own wants and wishes, to please a mere
girl who is worthy of no consideration whatever.
And consideration is not the word for what I have
received from my grandfather always and always;
and if I could forget all he has done for me and
been to me—if I could be so ungrateful as to forget
all those years of affection and sympathy and
constant kindness—"

She never finished the sentence.  He fancied her
eyes were moist as she turned her head away;
anyhow he dared not break in upon the silence; these
confidences had been sacred things.  And indeed
there was no opportunity for further speech on this
subject; for presently old George Bethune made
his appearance, radiant, buoyant, high-spirited, with
a sonorous stanza from Tannahill to greet the
awakening of the new day.

Now no sooner had Lord Musselburgh arrived on
board the *Villeggiatura* on the same morning than
Mrs. Ellison went to him and told him all her story,
which very much surprised him, and also concerned
him not a little, for it seemed as though he was in
a measure responsible for what had happened to
Vincent.

"My dear Mrs. Ellison," said he, "I can assure
you of one thing: it is quite true that your nephew
was in the room when Mr. Bethune and his
granddaughter called on me, but I am positively certain
that there was no introduction and that he did not
speak a single word to them there.  How he got to
know them I cannot imagine; nor how they could
have become so intimate that he should ask them
to be his guests down here at Henley.  And his sole
guests, you say?—Yes, I admit, it looks queer.  I
hope to goodness there is no kind of entanglement—"

"Oh," said Mrs. Ellison, in sudden alarm; "don't
imagine anything from what I have told you I
There may be nothing in it: he as good as declared
there was nothing in it: and he is so fiery and
sensitive—on this one point—why, that is the most
serious feature of it all!  He looks you straight in
the face, and dares you to suspect anything.  But
really—really—to have those two companions—and
no others—on a house-boat at Henley: it is a
challenge to the world!"

"Looks rather like it," said Lord Musselburgh;
and then he added: "Of course you know that Vin
has always been a Quixotic kind of chap—doing
impossible things if he thought them right—and all
that sort of thing.  But it's very awkward just at
this moment.  There must be some powerful
attraction, of one kind or another, to have made him
give himself over so completely to these new
friends; for he has not been near me of late; and
yet here I have in my pocket a letter that concerns
him very closely, if only he would pay attention to
it.  I don't mind telling you, Mrs. Ellison, for you
are discretion itself—"

"I think you may trust me, Lord Musselburgh,"
she said, with a smile.

"Very well, then," said he, lowering his voice.
"I hear that there will be a vacancy at
Mendover—certainly at the next General Election, but more
probably much sooner: old Gosford has become
such a confirmed hypochondriac that he will hardly
leave his room; and his constituents are grumbling
as much as they dare—for he has got money, you
know, and the public park he gave them wants
further laying out, and statues, and things.  Very
well; now I have in my pocket a darkly discreet
letter from the Committee of the Mendover Liberal
Association asking me to go down and deliver an
address at their next meeting, and hinting that if I
could bring with me an acceptable candidate—"

He paused, and for a second a cynical but
perfectly good-humoured laugh appeared in his eyes.

"My dear Mrs. Ellison," said he, "I am deeply
grateful.  I thought you might express some
astonishment at my being consulted in so important
an affair.  But the fact is, I, also, am expected to
do something for that park; and perhaps this
invitation was only a little hint to remind me of my
local responsibilities.  However, that is how the
case stands; and I had thought of taking your
nephew down with me—

"A vacancy at Mendover," said Mrs. Ellison, in
awe-struck tones, "where you are simply
everybody!  Oh, Lord Musselburgh, what a chance for
Vin!"

"And then, you know," continued the young peer,
"I want to bring him out as a Tory Democrat, for
that is a fine, bewildering sort of thing, that
provokes curiosity: you call yourself a Tory and can
be as revolutionary as you like, so that you capture
votes all round.  Why, I've got Vin's programme
all ready for him in my pocket: a graduated
income-tax, free education, leasehold enfranchisement,
compulsory insurance, anything and everything
you like except disestablishment—disestablishment
won't work at Mendover.  Now, you see,
Mrs. Ellison, if I could get Vin properly coached,
he has all the natural fervour that unhappily I lack;
and after I had made my few little jokes which
they kindly take for a speech, I could produce him
and say 'Here, now, is the young politician of the
new generation; here's your coming man; this is
the kind of member the next quarter-of-a-century
must return to the House of Commons.'  But if
there is any Delilah in the way—"

Mrs. Ellison crimsoned.

"No, Lord Musselburgh," she said.  "No.  You
need have no fear."

However, she seemed perturbed—perhaps in her
anxiety that her nephew should not miss this great
opportunity.  Presently she said—

"Tell me, what do you know of this old man?—I
can't make him out at all."

"I?  I know nothing, or next to nothing," he said,
lightly, as he gazed abroad on the busy river.  "I
remember Vin asking me the same question—I
suppose out of curiosity about the girl.  My
recollection of her is that she was extremely
pretty—refined-looking—lady-like, in fact—"

"She is, indeed," said Mrs. Ellison, with decision,
"and that is what makes the situation all the more
dangerous—assuming, of course, that there is any
ground for one's natural suspicions.  No, Vin is the
last man in the world to be captured by any vulgar
adventuress; he is at once too fastidious and too
proud.  But then, you see, he is well known to be
the son of a very wealthy man; and there might be
a design—"  She hesitated for a moment: then she
said, half impatiently: "Lord Musselburgh, tell me
how you came to know this old man: he could not
have sprung out of the earth all of a sudden."

He told her, as briefly as might be.

"That was all?" she repeated, eyeing him shrewdly.

"Yes."

"You are sure?"

"What do you mean?  That is really all I
know of the old gentleman: isn't that what you
asked?"

"But was that the whole of the interview, if I
may be so impertinent as to inquire?" she
demanded again.

"Ob, yes, it was," Lord Musselburgh said; and
then he added, indifferently: "Of course I
subscribed something towards the publication of a book
he mentioned—he had written to me before about
the project."

"Oh, there was money?" she said.

A slight tinge on Lord Musselburgh's forehead
showed that he had not intended to make this
admission.

"Oh, nothing—a trifle—it is usual when a book
is coming out by subscription."

Mrs. Ellison sate silent for a little while: there
was plenty going on on the river to interest her
companion.  Then by-and-bye she said slowly—

"Well, I had intended to keep clear of these new
friends of Vin's.  I thought it would be more
prudent for me to know nothing.  It is true, I was
introduced to them yesterday afternoon; but I
wished that to be all; I thought I would rather
withdraw; and let things take their course.  But
I don't know that that would be honest and right.
Vin is a young man with many fine and noble
qualities—perhaps a little too fine and noble for the
ordinary work-a-day world; and I think he ought to
have the benefit of my sadly-earned experience and
callous nature—"

Lord Musselburgh laughed: he did not take her
too seriously.

"He is my own boy," she continued, "I would do
anything for him.  And I'm not going to let him
be entrapped—if that is what all this means.  I
know he is very angry with me just now; probably
he would not speak to me if he were to meet me
this minute; but that won't prevent my speaking
to him.  I'm going to put my pride in my pocket,
Lord Musselburgh.  I'm going to find out something
more about this picturesque old gentleman, who
talks so grandly about the Beatons, and the de
Bethunes, and their coats of arms, and who accepts
a £10 note—or perhaps only a £5 note?—on account
of a book that is not yet published.  And if there is
any sort of scheme on foot for getting hold of the
son of so notoriously wealthy a man as Harland
Harris, then I want to make a little inquiry.
Yesterday Vin indignantly complained that I was
prejudiced, and that I had no right to form any
opinion about those friends of his because I would
not go along and dine with him and them last
evening.  Very well, I will go to him, and make up
the quarrel, and ask him to repeat the invitation for
this evening—"

"For this evening?" repeated Lord Musselburgh,
in tones of deep disappointment.  "You don't mean
you are going to leave all your friends here and go
and dine somewhere else?"

"If I can procure an invitation.  It is my duty.
I'm not going to let my boy be made a fool of, even
if I have to sacrifice a little of my own personal
comfort."

"Yes, that's all very well," said Lord Musselburgh,
gloomily, "but I did not bargain for your going
away like that on the only evening I shall be here.
If I had known—"

He was on the point of saying he would not have
come down: but that would have been too bold
an avowal.  He suddenly hit upon another happy
suggestion.

"You said that Vin had only those two on board
with him?  Well, if he asks you to dine with him,
won't he ask me too?"

Mrs. Ellison laughed, and shook her head.

"No, no.  Another stranger would put them on
their guard.  I must manage my Private Investigation
all by myself.  But you need not look so
disconsolate.  There are some really nice people
here, as you'll find out by-and-bye; and the Drexel
girls are driving over from Great Marlow—they are
Americans, so you will be properly appreciated:
they will try their best to make you happy."

"How late shall you stay on board Vin's boat?"
he asked, heedless of these smaller attractions.

"I shall be back here by ten—perhaps by half-past nine."

"Is that a promise?"

"Yes, it is—ten at latest."

"Otherwise I should go back to town in the
afternoon," said he, frankly.

"What nonsense!" the young widow exclaimed
(but she did not seem resentful).  "Well, now, I
must go along to the *White Rose*, and make my
peace, and angle for an invitation; and then, if I
get it, I must concoct my excuses for Mrs. Lawrence.
Anyhow I shall be on board the *Villeggiatura* all the
afternoon; and then I hope to have the pleasure of
introducing you to Louie Drexel—that is the young
lady I have designed for Vin, when he has shaken
off those adventurers and come to his right mind."

Almost immediately thereafter Mrs. Ellison had
secured a boatman to pull her along to the *White
Rose*; and as she drew near, she perceived that
Maisrie Bethune was alone in the stern of the
house-boat, standing upright on the steering-thwart, and
with both hands holding a pair of field-glasses to
her eyes—an unconscious attitude that showed the
graceful figure of the girl to the best advantage.

The observant visitor could also remark that her
costume was simplicity itself: a blouse of white
soft stuff, with wide sleeves and tight cuffs; a belt
of white silk round her waist; and a skirt of blue
serge.  She wore no head-covering; and her
neatly-braided hair caught several soft-shining hues from
the sun—not a wonder and glory of hair, perhaps,
(as Vin Harris would have deemed it) but very
attractive all the same to the feminine eye, and
somehow suggestive of girlhood, and making for
sympathy.  And then, when a "Good-morning!"
brought round a startled face and a proud, clear
look that was nothing abashed or ashamed,
Mrs. Ellison's conscience smote her that she had made
use of the word adventuress, and bade her wait
and see.

"Good-morning!" Maisrie Bethune answered;
and there came a touch of colour to the fine and
sensitive features as she knew that the young
matron was regarding her with a continuation of
the curiosity of the preceding afternoon.

"Have the gentlemen deserted you?  Are you
all alone?" Mrs. Ellison said.

"Oh, no; they are inside," was the response.
"Would you like to see Mr. Harris?  Shall I call him?"

"If you would be so kind!"—and therewith
Maisrie disappeared into the saloon, and did not
return.

It was Vincent that came out—with terrible
things written on his brow.

"Don't look at me like that, Vincent Harris!"
Mrs. Ellison exclaimed, half-laughing and
half-annoyed.  "What have I done?  It is you who are
so hasty and inconsiderate.  But I've come to make
it all up with you; and to ask you to ask me to
dine with you to-night."

"No, thank you, aunt," he said, civilly enough.
"You are very kind; but the fact is you would
come with a prejudice; and so you'd better not
come at all."

Well, she had to be circumspect; for not only
was her own boatman behind her, but there was a
possibility of some stray sentence penetrating into
the saloon.

"Come," she said, in a sort of undertone, to him;
and she had a pretty, coaxing, goodnatured way
with her when she chose, "I am not going to allow
you to quarrel with me, Vin; and I bring a flag of
truce; and honourable proposals.  I saw you were
offended with me last evening; and perhaps I was
a little selfish in refusing your invitation; but you
see I confess the error of my ways, for here I am
begging you to ask me again."

"Oh, if you put it that way, aunt—"

"Oh, no, I don't put it that way!" she said.
"Not if you speak like that.  Come, be amiable!
I've just been talking to Lord Musselburgh—"

"And, of course, you crammed all your wild
ideas into his head!" he exclaimed.

"Whoever heard of poor me having ideas!" she
said, with a winning good-humour to which he
could not but yield.  "It isn't for me to have ideas;
but I may have prejudices; and I'm going to leave
them, all on board the *Villeggiatura* this evening, if
you say yes."

"Of course I say yes—when you are like yourself,
aunt," he responded at once, "and I shall be very
glad indeed.  And what is more," said he, in a still
lower tone, "when you have really met—certain
people—and when you have to confess that you
have been unjust, I don't mean to triumph over
you.  Not a bit.  If you have done any injustice,
you know yourself how to make it up—to them.
Now that's all right and settled: and I'm really
glad you're coming.  Seven o'clock; and the dress
you've got on."

"Oh, but, mind you," said she, "you don't seem
to appreciate my goodness in humbling myself so
as to pacify your honourable worship.  Do you know
what I shall have to do besides?  How am I to
explain to the Lawrences my running away from
their party?  And here is Lord Musselburgh come
down; and the Drexel girls are expected; so you
see what I am doing for you, Vin—"

"You're always good to me, aunt—when you choose
to be reasonable and exercise your common-sense—"

"Common-sense!" she retorted, with a malicious
laugh in her eyes.  Then she said, quite seriously:
"Very well, Vin: seven o'clock: that is an excellent
hour, leaving us all a nice long evening; for I must
get back to the *Villeggiatura* early."

And so that was all well and amicably settled.
But Master Vin, though young in years, had not
tumbled about the world for nothing; and a little
reflection convinced him that his pretty aunt's
change of purpose—her abandonment of her resolve
to remain discreetly aloof—had not been prompted
solely, if at all, by her wish to have that little
misunderstanding between him and her removed.
That could have been done at any time; a few
words of apology and appeal, and there an end.
This humble seeking for an invitation which she
had definitely refused the day before meant more
than that; it meant that she had resolved to find
out something further about these strangers.  Very
well, then, she was welcome: at the same time he
was resolved to receive this second visit not as he
had received the first.  He was no longer anxious
about the impression these two friends of his might
produce on this the first of his relatives to meet
them.  She might form any opinion she chose: he
was indifferent.  Nay, he would stand by them on
every point; and justify them; and defy criticism.
If he had dared he would have gone to Maisrie and
said: "My aunt is coming to dinner to-night; but
I will not allow you to submit yourself to any ordeal
of inspection.  You shall dress as you like, as
carelessly or as neatly as you like; you shall wear your
hair hanging down your back or braided up, without
any thought of her; you shall be as silent as you
wish—and leave her, if she chooses, to call you
stupid, or shy, or sulky, or anything else."  And
he would have gone to the old man and said:
"Talk as much and as long as ever you have a
mind; you cannot babble o' green fields too
discursively for me; I, at all events, am sufficiently
interested in your claims of proud lineage, in your
enthusiasm about Scotland and Scottish song, in
your reminiscences of many lands.  Be as
self-complacent and pompous as you please; fear
nothing; fear criticism least of all."  And perhaps,
in like manner, he would have addressed Mrs. Ellison
herself: "My dear aunt, it is not they who
are on their trial, it is you.  It is you who have
to show whether you have the courage of honest
judgment, or are the mere slave of social custom
and forms."  For perhaps he, too, had imbibed a
little of the "Stand Fast, Craig Royston!" spirit?
Bravado may be catching—especially where an
innocent and interesting young creature of eighteen
or so is in danger of being exposed to some deadly
approach.

Of course this carelessly defiant attitude did not
prevent his being secretly pleased when, as seven
o'clock drew near, he perceived that Maisrie Bethune
had arranged herself in an extremely pretty, if
clearly inexpensive, costume; and also he was in no
wise chagrined to find that Mrs. Ellison, on her
arrival, appeared to be in a very amiable mood.
There was no need to ask her "O come ye in peace
here, or come ye in war?": her manner was most
bland; in particular she was adroitly flattering
and fascinating towards old George Bethune, who
accepted these little attentions from the charming
widow with a grave and consequential dignity.  The
young host refused to sit at the head of the table;
he had the places arranged two and two—Mrs. Ellison,
of course, as the greater stranger and the
elder woman, on his right, and Maisrie opposite to
him.  During the general dinner-talk, which was
mostly about the crowd, and the races, and the
dresses, Mrs. Ellison casually informed her nephew
that she had that afternoon won two bets, and also
discovered that she and Lord Musselburgh were to
meet at the same house in Scotland the coming
autumn: perhaps this was the explanation of her
extreme and obvious good humour.

And if any deep and sinister design underlay this
excessive amiability on her part, it was successfully
concealed; meantime all was pleasantness and
peace; and the old gentleman, encouraged by her
artless confidences, spoke more freely and frankly
about the circumstances of himself and his
granddaughter than was his wont.

"I see some of the papers are indignant about
what they call the vulgar display of wealth at
Henley regatta," the young widow was saying, in a very
unconcerned and easy fashion; "but I wish those
gentlemen would remember that there is such a
thing as imputation of motives, and that imputing
motives is a common resource of envy.  If I have a
house-boat, and try to make it as pretty as ever I can,
both inside and out, why should that be considered
display of wealth—display of any sort?  I like nice
things and comfortable things around me; I don't
mind confessing it; I am a selfish woman—"

"There are some who know better, aunt," her
nephew interposed.

"Young gentleman," said she, promptly, "your
evidence isn't worth anything, for you have expectations.
And I am not to be flattered.  I admit that
I am a selfish and comfort-loving woman; and I
like to see pretty things around me, and an
abundance of them; and if I can only have these at the
cost of being charged with ostentation and display,
very well, I will pay the price.  If it comes to that,
I never saw anything beautiful or desirable in
poverty.  Poverty is not beautiful; never was, never
is, never will be beautiful; it is base and squalid
and sordid; it demeans men's minds, and stunts
their bodies.  I dare say poverty is an excellent
discipline—for the rich, if they would only submit
to a six mouths' dose of it now and again; but it is
not a discipline at all for the poor; it is a curse; it
is the most cruel and baleful thing in the world,
destroying self-respect, destroying hope, ambition,
everything.  Oh, I know the heresy I'm talking.
There's Master Vin's papa: he is never done preaching
the divine attributes of poverty; and I have no
doubt there are a good many others who would be
content to fall down and worship *la bonne déesse de
la pauvreté*—on £30,000 a year!"

Master Vin sniggered: he was aware that this
was not the only direction in which the principles of
the philosopher of Grosvenor Place were somewhat
inconsistent with his practice.  However, it was
old George Bethune who now spoke—as one having
experience.

"I quite agree," said he to Mrs. Ellison.  "I can
conceive of nothing more demoralising to the nature
of man or woman than harsh and hopeless poverty,
a slavery from which there is no prospect of escape.
My granddaughter and I have known what it is to be
poor; we know it now; but in our case every day
brings possibilities—we breathe a wider air,
knowing that at any moment news may come.  Then
fancy plays her part; and imagination can brighten
the next day for us, if the present be dark enough.
Hopeless poverty—that is the terrible thing; the
weary toil leading to nothing; perhaps the
unfortunate wretch sinking deeper and deeper into the
Slough of Despond.  Maisrie and I have met with
trials; but we have borne them with a stout heart;
and perhaps we have been cheered—at least I know
I have been—by some distant prospect of the
Bonnie Mill-dams o' Balloray, and a happier future
for us both."

"Balloray?" she repeated, inquiringly.

"Balloray, in Fife.  Perhaps you have never
heard of the Balloray law-suit, and I will not inflict
any history of it upon you at present," he continued,
with lofty complaisance.  "I was merely saying
that poverty is not so hard to bear when there are
brighter possibilities always before you.  If, in our
case, we are barred in law by the Statute of
Limitations, there is no Statute of Limitations in the
chapter of accidents.  And some remarkable
instances have occurred.  I remember one in which a
father, two sons, and a daughter were all drowned
at once by the sinking of a ship, and the property
went bodily over to the younger branch of the
family, who had been penniless for years.  It is
the unexpected that happens, according to the
saying; and so we move from day to day towards
fresh possibilities; and who can tell what morning
may not bring us a summons to make straight for
the Kingdom of Fife?  Not for myself do I care; I
am too old now; it is for my granddaughter here;
and I should pass happily away and contented if I
could leave her in sole and undisputed possession of
the ancient lands of the Bethunes of Balloray."

What pang was this that shot through Vincent's
heart?  He suddenly saw Maisrie removed from
him—a great heiress—unapproachable—guarded by
this old man with his unconquerable pride of
lineage and birth.  *She* might not forget old
friends; but *he*?  The Harris family had plenty
of money; but they had nothing to add to the
fesse between three mascles, *or*, and the otter's
head; nor had any of their ancestors, so far as was
known, accompanied Margaret of Scotland on her
marriage with the Dauphin of France, or taken
arms along with the great Maximilien de Bethune,
duc de Sully.  In imagination the young man saw
himself a lonely pedestrian in Fifeshire, regarding
from a distance a vast baronial building set amid
black Scotch firs and lighter larches, and not daring
even to draw near the great gate with the otter's head
in stone over the archway.  He saw the horses being
brought round to the front entrance—a beautiful
white Arab and a sturdy cob: the hall door opens—the
heiress of Balloray descends the wide stone steps—she
is assisted to mount, and pats that beautiful
white creature on the neck.  And will she presently
come cantering by—her long hair flowing to the
winds, as fair as it used to be in the olden days
when the shifting lights and mists of Hyde Park
gave it ever-varying hues?  Can he steal aside
somewhere?—he has no desire to claim
recognition!  She has forgotten the time when, in the
humble lodgings she used to sing "*Je ne puis rien
donner, qu' mon coeur en mariage*"; she has wide
domains now; and wears an ancient historic name.
And so she goes along the white highway, and
under the swaying boughs of the beeches, until she
is lost in a confusion of green and gold...

"And in the meantime," said Mrs. Ellison (Vincent
started: had that bewildering and far-reaching
vision been revealed to him all in one brief,
breathless second?) "in the meantime, Mr. Bethune, you
must derive a great deal of comfort and solace from
your literary labours."

"My literary labours," said the old man, slowly
and absently, "I am sorry to say, are mostly
perfunctory and mechanical.  They occupy attention
and pass the time, however; and that is much.
Perhaps I have written one or two small things
which may survive me for a year or two; but if that
should be so, it will be owing, not to any merit of
their own, but to the patriotism of my countrymen.
Nay, I have much to be thankful for,", he continued,
in the same resigned fashion.  "I have been spared
much.  If I had been a famous author in my younger
days, I should now be reading the things I had
written then with the knowledge that I was their
only reader.  I should be thinking of my
contemporaries and saying 'At one time people spoke of
me as now they are speaking of you.'  It is a kind
of sad thing for a man to outlive his fame; for the
public is a fickle-minded creature, and must have
new distractions; but now I cannot complain of
being forgotten, for I never did anything deserving
of being remembered."

"Grandfather," said Maisrie, "surely it is unfair
of you to talk like that!  Think of the many friends
you have made through your writings."

"Scotch friends, Maisrie, Scotch friends," he said.
"I admit that.  The Scotch are not among the
forgetful ones of the earth.  If you want to be made
much of," he said, turning to Mrs. Ellison, "if you
want to be regarded with a constant affection and
gratitude, and to have your writings remembered
and repeated, by the lasses at the kirn, by the
ploughman in the field, by gentle and simple alike,
then you must contrive to be born in Scotland.
The Scottish heart beats warm, and is constant.  If
there is a bit of heather or a blue-bell placed on my
grave, it will be by the hand of a kindly Scot."

Dinner over, they went out and sate in the cool
twilight and had coffee, while the steward was
clearing away within.  Mrs. Ellison, faithful to her
promise to Lord Musselburgh, said she had not long
to stay; but her nephew, having a certain scheme
in his mind, would not let her go just yet; and by
and bye, when the saloon had been lit up, he asked
her, in a casual kind of fashion, whether before she
went she would not like to hear Miss Bethune sing something.

"Oh, I should like it of all things!" she replied
instantly, with a reckless disregard of truth.

Maisrie glanced at her grandfather.

"Yes, certainly—why not?" said he.

"Then," said their young host, "I propose we go
in to the saloon again; it will be quieter."  For
there was still a plash of oars on the river, and an
echoing call of voices in the meadows beyond.

When they had returned into the saloon, Maisrie
took up her violin; and Mrs. Ellison bravely
endeavoured to assume an air of interested
expectancy.  The fact was she disliked the whole
proceeding; here would be some mere exhibition of
a schoolgirl's showy accomplishments; she would
have to say nice things; and she hated telling
lies—when nothing was to be gained.  Maisrie made
some little apology; but said that perhaps
Mrs. Ellison had not heard the *Claire Fontaine*, which is
a favourite song of the Canadians.  Then she drew
her bow across the strings.

Vincent need not have been so anxious.  Hardly
had Maisrie begun with

   |  "*A la claire fontaine,*
   |  *M'en allant promener—*"

than Mrs. Ellison's air of forced attention instantly
vanished; she seemed surprised; she listened in a
wondering kind of way to the low, clear tones of
the girl's voice that were so curiously sincere and
penetrating and simple.  Not a schoolgirl's showing
off, this; but a kind of speech, that reached the
heart.

   |  "*Sur la plus haute branche*
   |  *Le rossignol chantait.*
   |  *Chante, rossignol, chante,*
   |  *Toi qui as le coeur gai.*
   |      *Lui ya longtemps que je t'aime,*
   |      *Jamais je ne t'oublierai.*"

Did she notice the soft dwelling on the *r*'s, Vincent
asked himself; and had she ever heard anything so
strangely fascinating?  Then the simple pathos of
the story—if there was any story—

   |  "*Chante, rossignol, chante,*
   |  *Toi qui as le coeur gai;*
   |  *Tu as le coeur à rire,*
   |  *Moi je l'ai-t-à pleurer.*

   |  *Tu as le coeur à rire,*
   |  *Moi j'e l'ai-t-à pleurer:*
   |  *J'ai perdu ma maîtresse*
   |  *Sans l'avoir mérité.*
   |      *Lui ya longtemps que je t'aime,*
   |      *Jamais je ne l'oublierai.*"
   |

"That is enough," said Maisrie, with a smile,
and she laid the violin in her lap.  "It is too long.
You never hear it sung altogether in Canada—only
a verse here and there—or perhaps merely
the refrain—"

"But is there more?—oh, please sing the rest of
it—it is delightful—so quaint, and simple, and
charming!" Mrs. Ellison exclaimed; and Master
Vin was a proud and glad young man; he knew
that Maisrie had all unaided struck home.

The girl took up her violin again, and resumed:

   |  "*J'ai perdu ma maîtresse*
   |  *Sans l'avoir mérité.*
   |  *Pour un bouquet de roses*
   |  *Que je lui refusai.*

   |  *Pour un bouquet de roses*
   |  *Que je lui refusai.*
   |  *Je voudrais que la rose*
   |  *Fût encore au rosier.*

   |  *Je voudrais que la rose*
   |  *Fût encore au rosier,*
   |  *Et moi et ma maîtresse*
   |  *Dans les mem's amitiés.*
   |      *Lui ya longtemps que je t'aime,*
   |      *Jamais je ne t'oublierai!*"
   |

Well, when the singing, if it could be called
singing, was over, Mrs. Ellison made the usual little
compliments, which nobody minded one way or the
other.  But presently she had to leave; and while
she was being rowed up the river by her nephew she
was silent.  When they reached the *Villeggiatura*
(the people were all outside, amid the confused light
of the lanterns in the dusk) she said to him, in a low
voice, as she bade him good-bye—

"Vin, let me whisper something to you—a
confession.  *Claire Fontaine* has done for me.  That
girl is a good girl.  She is all right, any way."

On a certain still, clear, moonlight night a
dog-cart containing two young men was being driven
away from the little town of Mendover, out into the
wide, white, silent country.  The driver was Lord
Musselburgh, and he seemed in high spirits, talking
to his companion almost continuously, while he
kept the stout little cob going at a rattling pace.

"I am more pleased than I can tell you," he was
saying.  "Quite a triumph!  Why, you took to it
as a duck takes to water.  Of course there's
something in having a responsive audience; and you
can always get a noble band of patriots to cheer
your proposal for a progressive income-tax when
not one in ten of them has any income-tax to pay.
I'm afraid they weren't quite so enthusiastic about
your scheme of compulsory insurance; indeed they
seemed a little disappointed and offended; the
Champion of the Proletariat was playing it a little
low down on them; but a heavily increasing
income-tax—oh, yes, that was splendid!—they saw
the Rothschilds caught at last, and had visions of a
land in which there shall be no more poor-rates or
police-rates, perhaps not even water-rates or
gas-rates.  But it was your confounded coolness that
surprised me—no beating about the bush—walking
straight into it—and without preparation, too—"

"I knew what I had to say," Vincent interposed,
with a becoming modesty, "and it seemed simple
enough to say it."

"Yes, and so it is—when you have acquired the
knack of forgetting yourself," said the young
nobleman, oracularly.  "And that appears to have come
naturally to you, my boy.  However, this is why I
am so particularly pleased with your successful
first appearance," Lord Musselburgh proceeded, as
the dog-cart went bowling along the silent, white
highway, between the black hedges.  "I am about
to unfold to you a great idea, Vin—perhaps
prematurely, but you will be discreet.  The project is
mine; but I want help to carry it through; you
and I must work together; and years and years
hence we shill be recognised as the Great Twin
Brethren, who saved the falling fortunes of
England."

Was he in jest or earnest?  Vincent, knowing
his friend's sub-cynical habit of speech, listened
without interposing a word.

"We shall earn for ourselves a deathless renown,
at very little cost—to us; it's the other people who
will have to pay, and we shall have all the glory.
Now what I propose is briefly this: I propose to
give all those good folk who profess a warm regard
for their native country a chance of showing what
their patriotism is worth.  I don't want them to
fight; there isn't any fighting going on at present
to speak of; and in any case the rich old
merchants, and maiden ladies, and portly bishops,
and ponderous judges—well, they'd make an
awkward squad to drill; but I mean to give them an
opportunity of testifying to their affection for the
land of their birth; and you, my blazing young
Tory-Democrat, if you can speak as freely as you
spoke to-night, you must carry the fiery torch north,
south, east, and west—till you've secured
Westminster Abbey for both of us, or at least a tablet
in St. Paul's.  Then look what a subject for your
eloquence you have—the guarding of England from
any possible combination of her foes—the
island-citadel made impregnable—'compass'd by the
inviolate sea'—defence not defiance—you understand
the kind of thing.  But really, Vin, you know, there
is going to be an awful stramash, as my old nurse
used to say, in Europe before the century is out;
and England's safety will lie in her being strong
enough to remain aloof.  And how?  Why, by
trebling her present navy."

"Trebling her present navy!" Vincent repeated,
in a vague sort of way.

"Yes," Musselburgh went on, coolly.  "And it
can easily be done, without involving a single
farthing of taxation.  I want the people of this
country to show what they can do voluntarily; I
want them to make a tremendous effort to render
Great Britain secure from attack for a century at
least; and the manner of doing it is to form a
National Patriotic Fund, to which everybody, man
and woman, merchant and apprentice, millionaire
and club-waiter, can subscribe, according to their
means and the genuineness of their patriotism.
Here is a chance for everybody; here is a test of
all those professions of love of country.  Why, it
would become a point of honour, with the very
meanest, if the nation were thoroughly aroused, and
if a splendid example were set in high places.
The Queen, now—who is more directly interested
in the safety of the country than she is?—why
should she not head the list with £100,000?  I
would call the fund the Queen's Fund; and I
should not wonder if we were to get two or three
maniacs—very useful maniacs—patriots they would
have been called in other days—to cut their
possessions in half, and hand the one half bodily
over to Her Majesty: that would be something
like an example!"

"But is it all a wild speculation, Musselburgh?"
asked Vincent, who was puzzled.  "Or do you
mean it seriously?"

"Ha and hum," said the young peer, significantly.
"That depends.  I should want to sound some of
the dukes about it.  And first of all I must have
some sort of scheme ready, to get rid of obvious
objections.  They might say 'Oh, you want to
treble the Navy?  Then in twenty years you'll find
yourself with a crowd of obsolete ships, and all your
money gone.'  That is not what I mean at all.  I
mean the formation of an immense voluntary
national fund, which will keep the Navy at double
or treble its present strength, not by a sudden
multiplication of ships, but by gradually adding
vessels of the newest construction, as improvements
are invented.  An immense fund, doubtless; for of
course there would be maintenance; but what
couldn't a rich country like England do if she
chose?  And that's what I'm coming to, with
regard to you, my young Demosthenes.  It would
be infinitely better—it would be safer—it would be
building on securer foundations—if the demand for
such a movement came from the country itself.  If
the Queen, and the dukes, and the millionaires were
to subscribe as if in answer to an appeal from the
people, the enthusiasm would be tremendous; it
would be such a thing as never happened before in
the history of England: talk about noble ladies
flinging their jewels into the public treasury?—why,
every school-girl would bring out her hoarded
pocket-money, with her lips white with patriotic
fervour.  England can subscribe on all possible
occasions for the benefit of other countries: for once
let her subscribe on her own behalf!"  Lord Musselburgh
went on, though it might have been hard to
say what half-mocking bravado intermingled with
his apparent enthusiasm.  "And that's where you
would come in.  You would be the emissary, the
apostle, the bearer of the fiery torch.  You've done
very well with the grocers' assistants of Mendover;
but fancy having to wake up England, Canada,
Australia, and the Cape to the necessity for making
the Mother Country once for all invulnerable, in the
interests of peace and universal freedom.  Why,
I could become eloquent about it myself.  They
cheered your graduated income-tax; but what
would they say to this?  Fancy what could be
done if every man in this country were to pledge
himself to give a year's income!  We don't ask
him to go out and have his legs or his arms
amputated, or his head shot off; we only ask for a
year's income—to secure peace and prosperity for
himself and his children and his children's children.
If there is any patriotism in the country at all, who
would say no?  And then when there is an iron
belt round England, and when there is a floating
mass of iron that could be sent at any moment to
form a wall round any of her dependencies, then,
I suppose, there might be a splendid assemblage in
Westminster Hall; and you and I—as the
instigators of this great national movement—but my
imagination stops short: I don't know what they
will make of us."

He himself had to stop short, for he was passing
through a wide gateway into the grounds surrounding
the Bungalow, and the carriage-drive was
almost invisible under the overshadowing trees.
Presently they had drawn up in front of the long,
low, rambling house; and here were lit windows,
and an open door, and servants.  The two young
men descended, and entered, and went into the
billiard-room, where cigars and soda-water and
similar things had been set out in readiness for
them; and here Lord Musselburgh, lying back in
a cane-bottomed chair, proceeded to talk in a less
random fashion about this project of his, until he
had almost persuaded his companion that there was
something reasonable and practicable in it, if only
it could be properly initiated.

"Anyhow," said he to his guest, as they were both
retiring for the night, "it is some big movement
like that, Vin, my lad, that you want to get
identified with, if your aim is to make a position in
English public life.  You have advantages.  You
can speak well.  You will have plenty of money.
You are beginning with the proletariat—that is
laying a foundation of popularity.  You have youth
and heaps of strength on your side.  Then —— is
known to be your friend.  What more?"

What more, indeed?  The future seemed to smile
on this young man; and if his dreams, waking or
sleeping, had been of great achievements and public
triumphs, who could have wondered?  But curiously
enough, just at this time, the forecasts that came to
him in moments of quiet were apt to be sombre.
He dreaded he hardly knew what.  And these
vague forebodings of the day took a more definite
shape in the far-reaching visions of the night; for
again and again there recurred to him that
phantasmal picture that had suddenly startled him
when old George Bethune was talking of the
possibilities that might be lying in store for his
granddaughter.  Vin Harris had never seen
Balloray—did not know where it was, in fact; but
night after night he beheld with a strange
distinctness the big baronial building, and the black
firs, and the gate with the otter's head in stone.
Had that been all!  But as regularly there came
forth the tall young girl with the long-flowing
hair; and he was a poor wanderer, cowering away
from recognition; and again she would ride by,
along the white road, until she was lost in the
dappled sun and shadow under the beeches.  Then
there was a song somewhere—perhaps it was the
trembling leaves that whispered the refrain—but
it was all about separation, and loneliness, and
the sadness of remembrance and of loss.  *Chante,
rossignol, chante, toi qui as le coeur gai*—this was
what he heard, or seemed to hear, away in that
distant land, where he had been left alone ... *J'ai
perdu ma maîtresse, sans l'avoir mérité* ... It was
strange that no birds sang in these woods, that no
lark hung quivering in those skies: all was
silence—save for that continuous murmur of farewell....
*Lui ya longtemps que je t'aime, jamais je ne t'oublierai*.
And sometimes the murmur rose into a larger
monotone; the big grey building, and the black
firs, and the highway, and the beeches, disappeared;
and behold in their stead was a great breadth of
sea, desolate, and rain-swept, and void of all sign of
life.  And was this the barrier now between him
and her?  Not merely that she was the heiress of
Balloray, under the guardianship of her implacably
proud old grandfather, but that she was away in
some far land, beyond those never-ending myriad
voices of the deep? ... *Pour un bouquet de roses, que
je lui refusai* ... What wrong had he done her?
What had he denied her, in the time when they
were as boy and girl together—when there was
no thought of her being the heiress of Balloray—when
she used to walk down through Hyde Park,
in her simple dress, and sit on the bench, while her
grandfather read his newspaper?  Then the grey
dawn would come; and he would awake to the
knowledge that he had been tortured by mere
phantasies; and yet these left something in his
mind, even during the actual and practical daylight
hours.  He begun to wish that there was some
bond—of what nature he had not determined—for
it was all a vague longing and wistful desire—a
bond that could so bind Maisrie and him together
that that great width of sea should not intervene.
For it was a sorrowful kind of thing—even when
the white hours of the daylight told him he had
only seen it in a dream.

But apart from all these dim anxieties and this
haunting unrest, came the strictly matter-of-fact
consideration that within an appreciable time old
George Bethune and his granddaughter would be
returning to the United States.  That was no
spectral ocean that would then lie between Maisrie and
him, but three thousand miles of the Atlantic; and
who could tell when the two wanderers might ever
see England again?  Nay, had not he himself been
implored to help in bringing about this separation?
Maisrie had begged of him to urge upon her
grandfather the necessity of getting the American book
done first, before setting out on the poetic pilgrimage
through Scotland which was to yield fruit of another
kind; and, of course, if the old man consented, the
first step to be taken was a voyage to New York.
Vincent had drawn many a fancy picture of a little
group of three, wandering away through the rich-hued
autumn days, by "lone St. Mary's silent lake,"
or by the banks of the silver Tweed; but now all
that was to be sacrificed; and he himself was to do
what he could towards sending the old man back to
America, and Maisrie with him.  Then there would
be no more of the long, quiet days of study, made
happy by anticipations of the evening; no more of
the pleasant little dinners in this or that restaurant;
no more of those wonderful twilights in the little
parlour, with their enchantments of music and happy
converse.  London, with Maisrie Bethune three
thousand miles away: that would be a strange
thing—that he could even now hardly imagine to himself.

Nay, it was a thing that he looked forward to
with such an unreasoning dread and dismay that he
began to construct all sorts of mad schemes for
defeating any such possibility; and at last he hit
upon one that seemed more or less practicable,
while it would in the meantime virtually absolve
him from his promise to Maisrie.  On the morning
after the meeting of the Mendover Liberal Association,
the two young men were returning to town by
train; and Vincent said to his companion—

"You were telling me the other night of the
Scotch newspaper-man whom you got to know in
New York: what did you say his name was?"

"Oh, you mean Hugh Anstruther?  I hope I
spoke no ill of him; for an enthusiastic patriotism
such as his is really something to admire in these
days.  A capital fellow, Hugh; until I fell across
him in New York I did not know that I had one
virtue transcending all the other virtues, and that
was simply my being a brother Scot."

"What did you say was the name of the paper
that he edits?"

"The *Western Scotsman*."

"And it was he who gave Mr. Bethune a letter of
introduction to you?"

But here Lord Musselburgh's manner instantly
changed: he had been answering these questions in
a careless way, looking out of the carriage window
most of the time: now he turned to his companion,
and regarded him with some scrutiny.

"Why do you ask, Vin?" he said.  "Do you
want to find out something further about the old man?"

Vincent's forehead flushed; and his eyes gloomed
dark.

"I do not," he made answer, in distinct tones.  "I
thank goodness my nature is not so suspicious.  It
seems to me extraordinary that two human beings
who have done nothing in the world to deserve it
should be regarded with a constant mistrust and
doubt.  Why?  Do you suspect everybody else in
the same way?"

"Oh, don't say that I suspect them," Lord Musselburgh
exclaimed at once—for he was an exceedingly
good-natured young man and had no wish to offend.
"I don't know them well enough—don't know
anything at all about them, in fact."

"You told me yourself that my aunt and you had
been talking them over; and I gathered enough
from what you said," was the younger man's retort.

"Mrs. Ellison is naturally anxious about anything
that concerns your future, Vin—or seems likely to
concern it," Musselburgh said.  "And you should
be the last to object."

"But I do object," he said, stiffly.  "I object
altogether to her canvassing the character of any
friends of mine; and to her putting her doubts and
suspicions and hints about them into any third
person's imaginations.  Oh, yes, I could make out
quite clearly what she had been saying.  That
night at Henley she came on a visit of inspection;
it was perfectly obvious.  And what is more, she
came with the hope of having her suspicions
confirmed; and I suppose she was horribly disappointed
that Maisrie Bethune did not drop her *h*'s, and that
Mr. Bethune did not beg the loan of a sovereign
from her!"

"Why so passionate, Vin—why so indignant?"
his companion put in, glancing at him curiously.

"Because I say it is a shame—a monstrous
shame," the young man said, with flaming eyes,
"that anyone should be insulted so!  Is it their
fault that they have no friends, that they are
unknown, that they are poor?  To be wealthy is
to be virtuous, of course; if you have a long
balance at your bankers', you are above suspicion
then; if you have house-boats, and four-in-hands,
and gold plate, you're all right.  I suppose," said
he, altering his tone, "that it was on that very
evening—the evening of her inspection—that my
aunt was kind enough to talk over those two friends
of mine with you, and tell you of all the portentous
things she suspected of them.  But I presume she
did not repeat to you the very last words she used
to me as she said good-night?"

"About what?"

"About Miss Bethune," said Vincent—though
it cost him an indescribable effort to pronounce her
name.

"Well, I believe she did," Lord Musselburgh
admitted.  "For she had just come away from
hearing Miss Bethune sing some Canadian song or
another; and she was very much struck; and she
said she had confessed as much to you.  Oh, more
than that—I don't precisely remember the words.
But really, Vin, when you come to think of it, you
must acknowledge that there is not much guidance
as to character, or antecedents, or any thing else,
in the mere singing of a song.  Mrs. Ellison, who
is always posing as a callous woman of the world, is
really very sympathetic and generous, and
warm-hearted; and she was quite taken captive by the
charm and simplicity of this *Claire Fontaine*—is
that the name of it?—but at the same time I should
not place too great a value—"

"I quite agree with you," the younger man said,
interrupting without apology.  "I place no more
value on my aunt's acquittal and commendation
than on her previous suspicions.  And—and—if
you don't mind, Musselburgh, I would rather not
have the question discussed further, nor Miss
Bethune's name mentioned in any way whatsoever."

"Oh, but remember I said nothing against her,"
Lord Musselburgh finally added, in perfect good
humour.  "How could I?  I hope your new friends
are all you think them; and as for the young lady,
it is difficult to believe any harm of so refined and
sweet a face.  But I hope you won't concern
yourself too much with them, Vin; you have other, and
perhaps more serious, interests in life; and it seems
to me that everything promises well for you.  Why,
at this moment, man, don't you know what ought to
be occupying all your attention?"

"What?" his companion asked—perhaps glad
enough to get away from that delicate topic.

"At least I know what I should be thinking of
if I were in your shoes.  I should be wondering
how much space the editor of the *Mendover Weekly
Guardian* was going to give me on Saturday morning next."

It was another editor whom Vincent had in his
mind at that moment.  As soon as he got back to
London he wrote and despatched the following

   "DEAR SIR,

"I hope you will be so kind as to
consider the contents of this note as strictly private
and confidential.  In a recent conversation with
Lord Musselburgh he informed me that it was you
who had given a letter of introduction to him to
Mr. George Bethune; and from Mr. Bethune
himself I learn that he, Mr. Bethune, is about to bring
out a volume on the Scottish poets in America, as
soon as he can conveniently get the materials
together.  But to this end it would appear that
he must revisit the United States and Canada, to
obtain particulars of the lives of the various poets
and verse-writers, and perhaps, also, examples of
their work.  Now I wish to ask you, as a friend of
Mr. Bethune's, whether all this fatigue and travel
might not be spared him, supposing there were
some person or persons in this country willing to
defray the cost of having those materials collected
for him.  To speak plainly, do you, sir, know of
any writer, connected with the press or otherwise,
who would undertake, for a sufficient consideration,
to bring together biographical memoranda of the
authors in question, along with specimens of their
work, which could be sent over here to Mr. Bethune,
for him to put into shape and issue in book-form?
Mr. Bethune, as you know, is an old man, who must
surely have had enough of travelling; moreover he
has in mind a leisurely ramble through Scotland
which, while also leading to literary results, would
involve much less fatigue than a voyage to the
United States and Canada.  I should be greatly
obliged if you would tell me whether you consider
it practicable to collect those materials by deputy;
also, if you know of anyone capable of undertaking
the task; and what remuneration he would probably
require.  I beg you to forgive me, a stranger, for
thus appealing to you; but I know you will not
grudge a little trouble for the sake of a friend and
a fellow Scotchman.

After sending off that letter the young man's
spirits lightened considerably; he saw there was
still a chance that Maisrie Bethune, her
grandfather, and himself might together set out on that
coveted perambulation of the legend-haunted
districts of the North.  And now he and they had
returned to their ordinary mode of life—which
perhaps pleased him better than the ostentatious
festivities of Henley.  Here was no staring crowd,
here were no suspicious friends, to break in upon
their close and constant companionship.  He rejoiced
in this isolation; he wished for no fourth person at
the quiet little dinners in the restaurants; he had
no desire that anyone should share the privacy
of the hushed small parlour where old George
Bethune loftily discoursed of poetry and philosophy,
of ancient customs and modern manners, and where
Maisrie played pathetic Scotch airs on the violin,
or sang in her low clear voice of *le pont d'Avignon*
or perhaps of *Marianson, dame jolie*.  Moreover, he
could not fail to perceive, and that with an
ever-increasing delight, that her old expression of sad
and wistful resignation was gradually being banished
from her eyes; and not only that, but a quite fresh
colour was come into her cheeks, so that the pale
sun-tinge was less perceptible.  Perhaps it was the
companionship of one nearer to her own age that
had made a difference in her life; at all events
much of her former shyness was gone; she met his
look frankly, sometimes with a touch of gratitude,
sometimes with simple gladness, as if his mere
presence was something that pleased her.  When
she was watering the flowers in the little balcony,
and caught sight of him over the way, she nodded
and smiled: he wondered whether it was that
faint-sun-tinge of the complexion that made her teeth
seem so clearly white.  He began to forget those
dreams of a wide intervening sea: this present
existence was so peaceable, and contented, and
happy.  And in spite of Maisrie's injunction, those
dreams of Scotland would recur: he saw three
newly-arrived strangers walking along Princes
Street, Edinburgh, in the silver glare of the
morning; and the middle one of the three—looking
away up to the dusky shadows of the Castle
rock—was no other than Maisrie Bethune herself, with
light and gladness shining in her eyes.

And what had old George Bethune to say to this
constant association and this fast friendship between
the two young people?  Well, old George Bethune
had an admirable capacity for enjoying the present
moment; and so long as the dinner was fairly
cooked and the claret to his taste, so long as he
had a small and faithful audience to listen to his
rhapsodies about Scottish song and Scottish heroism,
and so long as Maisrie's violin was in tune and her
hand as sensitive as ever on the trembling strings,
he did not seem to pay much heed to the future.
Perhaps it was but natural that one who had
wandered so far and wide should welcome a little
peace at last; and perhaps he intentionally blinded
his eyes; at all events the young people were
allowed the utmost freedom of companionship—it
was as if these three formed but one family.

One night, as Vincent was about to leave, the
old gentleman said to him—

"About to-morrow evening: I presume we dine
at Mentavisti's?"

"Oh, yes, certainly: we've tried a good many
places, and we can't do better than Mentavisti's,"
the young man answered—as if it mattered one
brass farthing to him what sort of dinner there was,
or where he got it, so long as Maisrie was at the
same table!

"Ah, very well.  For this is how I am situated,"
said Mr. Bethune, gravely and grandly as befitted
the seriousness of the theme.  "I have an
appointment in Jermyn-street at six o'clock.  I may be
detained.  Now I can undertake to be at Mentavisti's
Restaurant at seven—and when the dinner-hour
is once fixed, to play shilly-shally with it seems
to me abominable—but I am not so sure that
I shall have time to return home first.  It will
be better, therefore, and everyway safer, for Maisrie
to come down by herself in a cab—"

"But mayn't I call for her?" the young man
suggested at once.  "You know she would much
rather walk down than drive."

"Oh, very well, very well, if you don't mind,"
said Mr. Bethune, with a lofty condescension—or
indifference; while Maisrie, instead of being in the
least confused by this proposal, looked up with
perfectly frank and pleased eyes, apparently giving
him a little message of thanks.

Nor was she in the least embarrassed on the
following evening, when he was ushered upstairs
by the landlady's daughter.  Maisrie was alone in
the little parlour, ready-dressed except as regarded
her gloves, and she was putting a final touch to
the few flowers with which she had adorned the
table.

"Good evening," said she, quite placidly.  "I
will be with you in a moment, as soon as I have
dried my fingers."

She disappeared for a second, and returned.
He hesitated before accompanying her to the door.

"Won't you give me one of those flowers?" said
he, rather breathlessly.

She seemed a little surprised.

"Now that I think of it," she said, "I have never
seen you wear a flower in your coat, as other
gentlemen do.  And I'm afraid there isn't one
here nearly fine enough—"

"If you were to give me a flower, I should
not destroy it by wearing it in my coat!" said he.

"Oh, merely a flower?" she asked.  She went
to the table.  "Will this one do?"

It was a white geranium that she handed him,
simply enough: he took out his pocket-book, and
carefully placed it between the leaves.  For the
briefest instant she regarded him as if in wonder
that he should seek to preserve so worthless a trifle;
but she made no remark; and then unconcernedly and
cheerfully she led the way downstairs, and together
they passed out into the open street.

It was a marvellous and bewildering thing to
think that he should be in sole and complete charge
of her, here in the midst of the great and busy
world of London.  Did these hurrying people guess
at his proud elation, his new-found sense of
guardianship and responsibility, his anxiety that
all things should be pleasant to her; or had they
hardly time even to notice this beautiful young
creature, her step light as a fawn, fresh colour in
her fair cheeks, happiness radiant in her eyes?
Perhaps they heeded her and the tall and handsome
youth by her side as little as she heeded them; for
indeed she seemed to be entirely engrossed in her
companion, talking, smiling, replying to him without
a shadow of self-consciousness or restraint.  To him
this new relationship was an amazing kind of thing:
she did not seem even to perceive it.  To him it
was an epoch in his life, to be for ever remembered:
to her—well, nearly every evening she walked out
in similar fashion with her grandfather, and she did
not appear to notice any difference: at least she
showed no sign.

But all at once Maisrie altered her manner; and
that was when he in the lightness of his heart
informed her that there was still a chance of their
setting out on that long contemplated pilgrimage to
the various poetic shrines of Scotland.

"Mr. Harris," she said, proudly, "you made me
a promise—"

"Yes, I know I did," he said; "but things have
changed, and I'm going to explain to you; and I
think you'll find everything satisfactory.  But first
of all, before I begin, I wish you wouldn't call me
'Mr. Harris.'  It sounds detestable.  You who are
so natural and straightforward in all your
ways—why don't you call me Vincent?"

"Don't you think that Mr. Vincent might be a
fair compromise?" she asked gently, and with her
eyes lowered.

"I've called you Maisrie once or twice, by
accident, and you didn't seem to mind," he pointed
out.

"I am sure I did not notice," she made answer
at once.  "How should I?  I am used to nothing else."

"Then I am to be allowed to call you Maisrie?"
said he, clutching eagerly at this new-found
privilege.  "And you will call me Vincent—when
you find Mr. Vincent become too formal: is it a
compact?"

"Yes, it is—Mr. Vincent—if you like," said she,
with a smile.  "But why do you make it so very
serious?"

"Because," said he, gravely, "when any solemn
bargain is completed, people shake hands to make
it secure."

"Not in the middle of Oxford-street?" she said.

"We will postpone the ceremony, if you prefer
it; and now I will begin and tell you how it is still
possible we may have that long ramble through
Scotland together.  You were anxious that before
anything of the kind were attempted, your
grandfather should go back to the United States to get
materials for his book on the Scottish poets in
America.  Well, now, it seems a pity to make such
a long voyage if it can be done without; and so I
have taken the liberty of sending over to New York
to see if there isn't some handy young fellow
there—some clerk or reporter—who would undertake to
collect all the necessary materials, and send them
over here for your grandfather to work up.  Then
we could go to Scotland all the same—that is, if
you will let me accompany you."

"Someone to collect the materials and send them
over?" she repeated; and then she said: "But
would that be fair, Mr. Harris—Mr. Vincent—would
that be honest?  Surely not!  The book would not
be my grandfather's book at all; properly it would
belong to the young man in New York."

"I beg your pardon," said he, with decision.  "He
only supplies the bricks; he does not build the
house.  When a Chancellor of the Exchequer
produces his budget, of course he claims it as his own;
but he has got his facts from the heads of departments,
and most likely his quotations have been
hunted out for him by his private secretary.  It
would be your grandfather's book, solely and
wholly."

"But the cost?" she said, after a second.  "Supposing
it were practicable, the expense—"

"Oh, never mind about that," said he, lightly.
"It will be next to nothing—you needn't mind
about that.  Our deputy in New York will find
very little difficulty in getting the memoranda that
he wants.  There is no sort of unnecessary modesty
about minor poets; they will be glad enough to
give him specimens of their work, as soon as it is
known what he aims at.  And in Scotland," he
continued (grown suddenly bold), "don't you see
how it would work?  Your grandfather must have
an occasional morning to give to his MSS; then
you and I could leave him in absolute peace and
quiet; and we might go away for a stroll up to
Arthur's Seat, or round the ramparts of the Castle,
and return to him by lunch-time.  Wouldn't that
be an excellent arrangement?"

"Yes, that would be very nice indeed," said she,
with a pleased expression: she seemed to look
forward to this close and constant companionship as
the most natural thing in the world.

And in fact so sanguine was the young man about
the success of his new scheme that, when the three
of them were seated at a small table in Mentavisti's
Restaurant, he ventured to hint to old George
Bethune his fond hope that he might be allowed
to join in that prolonged excursion through
Scotland; and the old man at once acquiesced.

"Yes, yes, why not?" he said; and then he went
on, absently: "Yet my nerve is not what it was.
Sometimes I hesitate.  It would grieve me more
than I can say if Maisrie here were to be
disappointed.  It is a long time since I was in the
country; perhaps I remember only the beautiful
things; and it is only of these she has heard me
talk.  When Sturrock thinks of the old home, the
dappled hills shine for him: you remember,
Maisrie?—

   |  'Oh native land!  Oh cherished home,
   |    I've sailed across the sea,
   |  And, though my wandering footsteps roam,
   |    My heart still turns to thee!
   |  My thoughts and dreams are sweet and bright
   |    With dew which love distils;
   |  While every gleam of golden light
   |    Falls on the Scottish hills.'

He forgets the mists and the rain and the darkened
days.  And you, Maisrie, you have been brought
up under fair blue skies; you have never learnt
how sombre days and wild and driving clouds stir
the imagination; perhaps, if you stood in the very
street where the 'bonnie Earl o' Moray came
sounding through the town,' you would see only the wet
pavements and the dull windows; and you might
turn to me and say 'Is this what you have talked
about to me, grandfather?'"  Then all of a sudden
he seemed to throw off this despondent fit as by
a violent effort.  "No, no!" said he, in quite a
different tone.  "I will not believe but that there
are still yellow cornfields and silver lakes in bonnie
Scotland, and the lark singing as high in the
heavens as when Tannahill, or Hogg, or Motherwell
paused to listen.  I will show you the red rowans
hanging from the mountain crag, and the golden
bracken down by the side of the burn; and if we
go still further away—to the lonely islands of the
western seas—then you must learn to forget the
soft prettiness of the sunnier south, and to let
the mysterious charm of isolation hold you, and
the majesty of the darkened mountains, and the
pathetic beauty of the wandering veils of rain.  I
would sooner forget the mother that bore me," he
said, with a proud ring in his voice, "than believe
that bonnie Scotland had lost her glamour and
wonder and fascination.  And you would be no
holiday-tourist, Maisrie; you belong by blood to
the 'land of wild weather'; and imagination is part
of the dowry of youth.  No, no; I do not fear.
I—I made a mistake when I said I was afraid—I am
not afraid of you, Maisrie—not afraid of you—you
have the fine sympathy, the intelligence, the quick
imagination that I can trust—I am not afraid of
you, Maisrie——"

"You need not be afraid, grandfather," the girl
said, gently—for she saw that he was somewhat
disturbed.  "Why should you be afraid,
grandfather?  I shall be looking with your eyes."

But the curious thing was that despite all this
talking about the projected pilgrimage, it never
seemed to come any nearer.  No mention of a date
or even of any approximate time, was ever made.
In like manner, their return to America, though the
old gentleman spoke of it now and again as a fixed
and definite and necessary thing, kept receding
backwards and backwards into a perfectly nebulous
future.  The present moment was everything to old
George Bethune, whether he was engaged with a
roe-deer cutlet at a restaurant in Regent-street, or
lighting his pipe and mixing his toddy on his
return home, while he was descanting on Barbour,
and Drummond, and Sir David Lindesay, or Ramsay,
and Ferguson, and Burns.  People were beginning
to leave town; Vincent had received, and
declined, an invitation to join a big house-party in
Argyllshire, notwithstanding that it was to the
same house that Mrs. Ellison and Lord
Musselburgh were going; but old George Bethune and
his granddaughter appeared to pay no heed to the
changing times and seasons; their placid, uneventful
life seemed quite enough for them.  And was it
not enough for this young man also, who had been
admitted to be their constant associate and friend?
Why should he vex himself about literary schemes
that were none of his devising?  Day by day he
waved a good-morning to Maisrie as she came to
water her flowers, and an answer came from her
smiling eyes; sometimes he walked out into the
parks in the afternoon, with her grandfather and
herself, and ever he rejoiced to see that the fine
peach-bloom on her cheek was surmounting the
sun-tinge that had been left there by travel; then
in the evening they had all London to choose from,
as to where they should dine, with a quiet stroll
homeward thereafter, to music, and dominoes, and
careless talk.  What more?  The great outer world
might go on its way, and welcome.

But Master Vin was about to be startled out of
this dreamful ease.  At last there came an answer
to the communication he had sent to the editor of
the Western Scotsman, with many apologies for
unavoidable delay: Mr. Anstruther, it appeared, had
been in Canada, taking his annual holiday among
his kinsmen and countrymen there.

"I must say your letter has astonished me beyond
measure," the writer went on, "and I would fain
believe that there is some great mistake somewhere,
which is capable of explanation.  It is quite true
that when I gave my venerable friend Mr. Bethune
a note of introduction to Lord Musselburgh, I was
aware that he had in view various literary projects—in
fact, his brain teems with them as if he were a
young man of five-and-twenty—the *perfervidum
ingenium Scotorum* in his case has taken hold of his
imagination; but I cannot understand how he could
have included in these the publication of a volume
on the Scottish poets in America, for the simple
reason that he must have known that such a work
was not only in progress here, but that it was near
completion.  Why, I myself showed Mr. Bethune
proofs of the early sheets of this volume; for the
author is a particular friend of mine; and as it was
being set up, he used to send me the sheets as they
were printed; and Mr. Bethune being in the habit
of calling at my office, I not only showed them to
him, but I fancy I let him take some of them away,
that he might read them at his leisure.  How he
should now propose to bring out a similar work—and
bespeak Lord Musselburgh's patronage for it, as
I presume he did—passes my comprehension, except
on the ground that, being an old man, he may have
suffered from some temporary attack of mental
aberration and forgetfulness.  I would rather believe
this than that a man whom I had taken for a
thorough Scot, loyal and true to the backbone, and
proud of his country and of his own name and
lineage, should be endeavouring to supplant another
worker who is already in possession of the field.
However, no actual harm can be done; for the
volume I speak of is on the eve of publication, and
no doubt it will be issued simultaneously in
England.  That is all I have to say, on a subject which
at present seems to me to have something of a
painful aspect—though I hope a satisfactory explanation
may be forthcoming.  In conclusion may I beg of
you to keep this letter private?  The facts are as I
have stated; but I would rather Mr. Bethune did
not know you had them from me.

For some time Vincent sat with this letter in his
hand, in a sort of stupefaction.  Curiously enough
his first question to himself was—What if
Mrs. Ellison should get to know?—would she not
triumphantly declare that her worst suspicions had been
confirmed?  That was but a first thought.  There
must be some explanation!  He had not associated
so continually with George Bethune—he had not
heard the old man's voice thrill with proud emotion
as he spoke of Scotland's hills and dales—he had not
seen his eyes fill with unbidden tears as he talked of
his granddaughter and the loneliness that might be
in store for her—all for nothing: not at once could
he be convinced that this old man was a mere
charlatan, a thief, a begging-letter impostor.  But
he had been startled; and when he reached his
lodgings in that small thoroughfare, he hardly
dared look across the way: he knew not what to
think.
